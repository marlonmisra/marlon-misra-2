    <h3 style="margin-top:0px">Ben Horowitz - The hard thing about hard things </h3>
    <br>
    <h4 >Summary</h4>

	<p class='v-project-description'>
	Ben Horowitz is a cofounder of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. In <i>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</i>, he shares his experience from Netscape, Loudcloud, and Opsware. The main reason I like this book is because it’s aimed at startups. Most similar books are written by consultants and are only relevant for large peacetime companies.  

	<br><br>

	The best CEOs exhibit brilliance and courage. Brilliance is straightforward but courage is underestimated. Running companies is extremely difficult and requires high pain tolerance. Ben was in countless situations where his company would have died in weeks where it not for a highly controversial decision that he made. CEOs should make important final decisions alone because they are the only ones who have full knowledge of the business. Therefore, when the board and investors disagree with you, and you are only slightly in favor of option A, you should still generally proceed. This is the best way to become courageous.   

	<br><br>

	Courage also relates to the mindset of there being a definite future. It’s  important to have faith in the future. Even preparing for a negative plan B can psychologically put you in a bad position. From Ben’s experience, the most common thing successful CEOs claim is that they never gave up. Founding CEOs tend be better than professional CEOs precisely because of their courage. 

	<br><br>
	For a company to be successful, it’s important to have a mission that’s so important that it supersedes everyone’s personal ambition. This will make everything else (recruiting, retention, culture, etc.) easier. For the product, it has to be significantly better than the current way of doing that thing. If that’s not the case, other big companies will crush you. For that reason, it’s important to be focused and get one thing right. Being super dominant in one thing is generally much better than being slightly above average in ten. 

	<br><br>
	Ben gives many management tips. One piece of advice I really liked is to try and look at situations through as many perspectives a possible. This helps to separate fact and fiction. For example, if someone wants a promotion, think about how that would affect his coworkers. Another tip is to share negative news openly when speaking to employees. Being overly positive is a cowardly thing to do and openness shows confidence. In board meetings, insert an agenda item titled “What are we not doing” to help long-term thinking. 

	<br><br>
	Ben gives many tips for hiring. He suggests that you should always look for extreme strengths rather than a lack of weakness. This is better because it is not good enough to build an average company. You want experts in each of your functions. Companies often win because they have one silver bullet like explained above. For executive hiring, consensus decisions always sway the process away from strength and toward lack of weakness. That is why the ultimate hiring decision should be made solo. You also want to be careful about management debt. Hiring is one of the areas where it’s extremely important not to rush. When new employees join, the Zuck approach is relevel them and not give out glamorous roles. This is the fair thing to do.

	<br><br>
	Training is one of the highest leverage activities that a manager can perform. Managers should have one-on-one meeting with their direct reports and the meetings should be owned by the report. CEOs should have opinions on everything and constantly be evaluating direct reports. Using the shit sandwich is good for junior employees but may not work for executives.  

	<br><br>
	For advancement, you want to be strict with your processes to avoid building a political organization. When people ask for raises or promotions you should not agree to them because it sets a terrible precedent. When deciding whether to promote someone from within or on the outside, think about how important inside knowledge is for the role. Senior people should be hired because of time. You’re always racing against time.  

	<br><br>
	For firing, Ben provides the following advice. First, managers should do their own firings. In the final meeting, managers should explain that this is company failure, that the decision is nonnegotiable, and be prepared with details about the benefits. For executive firing, managers should frame the layoff as an integration problem. Two common reasons why people quit are bad managers and lack of learning. One way to tackle both is great training.  

	<br><br>
	Scaling is difficult and people will have to be replaced in the process. The big issues are communication, common knowledge, and decision-making. You have to decide whether to organize the company around functions (sales, product management, etc.) or self-contained business units. To answer the question, focus on the desired output first. 

	<br><br>
	There is a big difference between peacetime CEOs and wartime CEOs. Both require different management techniques. For example, when Jobs returned to Apple and there were weeks of cash left, everyone had to focus and listen to Steve without questioning. In contrast, when Google instigated 20% time, that was a classic example of a company trying to figure out what to do next in a slow creative way.

	<br><br>
	Regarding exits, a company should stay independent if it is very early on in a soon-to-be very large market and has a good chance of being number one. If a potential acquirer approaches, a good answer is "We are not for sale." It conveys that you aren’t ready to sell but it but it also leaves the door open to a particularly aggressive buyer.

	<br><br>

	<li><p>Note to self: It’s a good idea to ask, “What am I not doing?” </p></li>

    <h4>Highlights</h4>

	<ul class='v-project-description'>
	<li><p>The problem with these books is that they attempt to provide a recipe for challenges that have no recipes. That's the hard thing about hard things--there is no formula for dealing with them.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Former secretary of state Colin Powell says that leadership is the ability to get someone to follow you even if only out of curiosity.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Looking at the world through such different prisms helped me separate facts from perception. This ability would serve me incredibly well later when I became an entrepreneur and CEO. In particularly dire circumstances when the "facts" seemed to dictate a certain outcome, I learned to look for alternative narratives and explanations coming from radically different perspectives to inform my outlook.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Andre and Roselie had been brought in by the venture capitalists as the "professional management team." Unfortunately, they understood very little about the products or the technology, and they sent the company off in one crazy direction after the next. This was the first time that I started to understand the importance of founders running their companies.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Mosaic was essentially a graphical interface to the Internet--a technology formerly only used by scientists and researchers. It amazed me. It was so obviously the future, and I was so obviously wasting my time working on anything but the Internet.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Companies began to get defined as "new economy" or as "old economy." And the new economy was winning. The New York Times called the Netscape IPO "world-shaking."</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>During this time I learned the most important rule of raising money privately: Look for a market of one. You only need one investor to say yes, so it's best to ignore the other thirty who say "no."</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>We'd gone from being the hottest startup in Silicon Valley to unfundable in six months. No matter who you are, you need two kinds of friends in your life. The first kind is one you can call when something good happens, and you need someone who will be excited for you. The second kind of friend is somebody you can call when things go horribly wrong--when your life is on the line and you only have one phone call.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>An early lesson I learned in my career was that whenever a large organization attempts to do anything, it always comes down to a single person who can delay the entire project. An engineer might get stuck waiting for a decision or a manager may think she doesn't have authority to make a critical purchase. These small, seemingly minor hesitations can cause fatal delays. I could not afford any hesitation, so I scheduled a daily meeting with Anthony, Jason, and the team--though they were now based in Plano. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>During acquisition talks, both sides had agreed that Tangram's CFO, John Nelli, would not become part of Opsware. But during the time between signing and close, John began to get severe headaches. His doctors discovered that he had brain cancer. Because he would not be an Opsware employee and it was a preexisting condition, he would not be eligible for health insurance under our plan. The cost of the treatment without health insurance would likely bankrupt his family. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>At the time, I felt horrible asking the team to make yet another big sacrifice. Amazingly, I found out while writing this book that I probably should have felt good about it. Of all the times I think of at Loudcloud and Opsware, the Darwin Project was the most fun and the most hard.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>After the speech came the hard work of defining the product. The product plan was weighed down with hundreds of requirements from our existing customers. The product management team had an allergic reaction to prioritizing potentially good features above features that might hypothetically beat BladeLogic. They would say, "How can we walk away from requirements that we know to be true to pursue something that we think will help?" It turns out that is exactly what product strategy is all about--figuring out the right product is the innovator's job, not the customer's job. The customer only knows what she thinks she wants based on her experience with the current product. The innovator can take into account everything that's possible, but often must go against what she knows to be true. As a result, innovation requires a combination of knowledge, skill, and courage. Sometimes only the founder has the courage to ignore the data; we were running out of time, so I had to step in: "I don't care about any of the existing requirements; I need you to reinvent the product and we need to win." Nine months later, when we released our new product we could now win any deal. Armed with the new product, Mark Cranney, head of sales, went to war.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>In my weekly staff meeting, I inserted an agenda item titled "What Are We Not Doing?" Ordinarily in a staff meeting, you spend lots of time reviewing, evaluating, and improving all of the things that you do: build products, sell products, support customers, hire employees, and the like. Sometimes, however, the things you're not doing are the things you should actually be focused on. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>However, if I'd learned anything it was that conventional wisdom had nothing to do with the truth and the efficient market hypothesis was deceptive. How else could one explain Opsware trading at half of the cash we had in the bank when we had a $20 million a year contract and fifty of the smartest engineers in the world? No, markets weren't "efficient" at finding the truth; they were just very efficient at converging on a conclusion--often the wrong conclusion.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Whenever a potential acquirer approached us, I would always reply, "We are not for sale." It was a great answer in that I wasn't ready to sell and it conveyed that, but it also left the door open to a particularly aggressive buyer. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>We'd built something from nothing, saw it go back to nothing again, and then rebuilt it into a $1.65 billion franchise. At that point, it felt like my business life was kind of over. I had hired all the best people that I knew or could find, and I had gone through every step from founding to going public to sale. I definitely did not feel like doing any of that again. But I had learned so much. It seemed like such a waste to do something completely different. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>There are several different frameworks one could use to get a handle on the indeterminate vs. determinate question. The math version is calculus vs. statistics.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>I never built that contingency plan. Through the seemingly impossible Loudcloud series C and IPO processes, I learned one important lesson: Startup CEOs should not play the odds. When you are building a company, you must believe there is an answer and you cannot pay attention to your odds of finding it. You just have to find it. I don't believe in statistics. I believe in calculus.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>People always ask me, "What's the secret to being a successful CEO?" Sadly, there is no secret, but if there is one skill that stands out, it's the ability to focus and make the best move when there are no good moves.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Your company did not unfold like the Jack Dorsey keynote that you listened to when you started. Your product has issues that will be very hard to fix. The market isn't quite where it was supposed to be. Your employees are losing confidence and some of them have quit. Some of the ones who quit were quite smart and have the remaining ones wondering if staying makes sense. You are running low on cash and your venture capitalist tells you that it will be difficult to raise money given the impending European economic catastrophe. You lose a competitive battle. You lose a loyal customer. You lose a great employee. The walls start closing in. Where did you go wrong? Why didn't your company perform as envisioned? Are you good enough to do this? As your dreams turn into nightmares, you find yourself in the Struggle.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Don't put it all on your shoulders. It is easy to think that the things that bother you will upset your people more. That's not true. The opposite is true. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>You think you have no moves? How about taking your company public with $2 million in trailing revenue and 340 employees, with a plan to do $75 million in revenue the next year? I made that move. I made it in 2001, widely regarded as the worst time ever for a technology company to go public. I made it with six weeks of cash left. There is always a move.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>One of the most important management lessons for a founder/CEO is totally unintuitive. My single biggest personal improvement as CEO occurred on the day when I stopped being too positive. There are three key reasons why being transparent about your company's problems makes sense. </p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>First is trust. In any human interaction, the required amount of communication is inversely proportional to the level of trust. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Second, the more brains working on the hard problems, the better. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Third, a good culture is like the old RIP routing protocol: Bad news travels fast; good news travels slow.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>If you run a company, you will experience overwhelming psychological pressure to be overly positive. Stand up to the pressure, face your fear, and tell it like it is.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Once you decide that you will have to lay people off, the time elapsed between making that decision and executing that decision should be as short as possible. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The message must be "The company failed and in order to move forward, we will have to lose some excellent people." Admitting to the failure may not seem like a big deal, but trust me, it is.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The most important step in the whole exercise is training the management team. Training starts with a golden rule: Managers must lay off their own people. They cannot pass the task to HR or to a more sadistic peer. </p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>They should explain briefly what happened and that it is a company rather than a personal failure. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>They should be clear that the employee is impacted and that the decision is nonnegotiable. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>They should be fully prepared with all of the details about the benefits and support the company plans to provide.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>Prior to executing the layoff, the CEO must address the company. Keep in mind what former Intuit CEO Bill Campbell told me--The message is for the people who are staying. The people who stay will care deeply about how you treat their colleagues. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>In other words, the wrong way to view an executive firing is as an executive failure; the correct way to view an executive firing is as an interview/integration process system failure. He said, "Ben, you cannot let him keep his job, but you absolutely can let him keep his respect.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Use appropriate language. Make clear with your language that you've decided. As previously discussed, use phrases like "I have decided" rather than "I think" or "I'd like." By doing this, you will avoid putting the employee in the awkward position of wondering whether he should lobby for his old job.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Through all of this, keep in mind that it is what it is and nothing you can say will change that or stop it from being deeply upsetting. Your goal should not be to take the sting out of it, but to be honest, clear, and effective.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>High-tech companies tend to track employee attrition in three categories.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>People who quit.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>People who got fired</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>People who quit, but it's okay because the company didn't want them anyway</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>I asked Andy why these great CEOs would lie about their impending fate. He said they were not lying to investors, but rather, they were lying to themselves. Andy explained that humans, particularly those who build things, only listen to leading indicators of good news.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>All these approaches reinforced to me was that we weren't facing a market problem. The customers were buying; they just weren't buying our product. This was not a time to pivot. So I said the same thing to every one of them: "There are no silver bullets for this, only lead bullets." They did not want to hear that, but it made things clear: We had to build a better product. There was no other way out. No window, no hole, no escape hatch, no back door. We had to go through the front door and deal with the big, ugly guy blocking it. Lead bullets.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>All the mental energy you use to elaborate your misery would be far better used trying to find the one seemingly impossible way out of your current mess. Spend zero time on what you could have done, and devote all of your time on what you might do. Because in the end, nobody cares; just run your company. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>I'd learned the hard way that when hiring executives, one should follow Colin Powell's instructions and hire for strength rather than lack of weakness. By running sales, I understood very clearly the strengths we needed. I made a careful list and set out to find the sales executives with the right skills and talents for Opsware.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>My old boss Jim Barksdale was fond of saying, "We take care of the people, the products, and the profits--in that order." It's a simple saying, but it's deep. "Taking care of the people" is the most difficult of the three by far and if you don't do it, the other two won't matter. Taking care of the people means that your company is a good place to work. Most workplaces are far from good. As organizations grow large, important work can go unnoticed, the hardest workers can get passed over by the best politicians, and bureaucratic processes can choke out the creativity and remove all the joy.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>In good organizations, people can focus on their work and have confidence that if they get their work done, good things will happen for both the company and them personally.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Me: "In summary, you and Tim are preventing me from achieving my one and only goal. You have become a barrier blocking me from achieving my most important goal. As a result, if Tim doesn't meet with each one of his employees in the next twenty-four hours, I will have no choice but to fire him and to fire you. Are we clear?" So was it really necessary for me to make such a dramatic speech and threaten one of my executives? I think it was, for the following three reasons</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Being a good company doesn't matter when things go well, but it can be the difference between life and death when things go wrong. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Things always go wrong. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Being a good company is an end in itself.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>A lot of companies think their employees are so smart that they require no training. That's silly.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>When I was director of product management at Netscape, I was feeling frustrated by how little value most product managers added to the business. Based on Andy's guidance, I wrote a short document called "Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager," which I used to train the team on my basic expectations. I was shocked by what happened next. The performance of my team instantly improved. Product managers whom I had almost written off as hopeless became effective. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Training is, quite simply, one of the highest-leverage activities a manager can perform. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>I found that there were two primary reasons why people quit.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>They hated their manager; generally the employees were appalled by the lack of guidance, career development, and feedback they were receiving. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>They weren't learning anything: The company wasn't investing resources in helping employees develop new skills. An outstanding training program can address both issues head-on.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>The other essential component of a company's training program is management training. I call this functional training.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Hiring from another company</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>A good rule of thumb is my Reflexive Principle of Employee Raiding, which states, "If you would be shocked and horrified if Company X hired several of your employees, then you should not hire any of theirs. The number of such companies should be small and may very well be zero. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>With that in mind, the best way to deal with these situations is openly and transparently. Once you become aware of the conflict between hiring the superstar employee and double-crossing your valued friend, you should get the issue onto the table by informing the employee that you have an important business relationship with his existing company and you will have to complete a reference check with the CEO prior to extending the offer. Let him know that if he does not want that to happen, then you will stop the process now and keep the process to date confidential.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>The most important thing to understand is that the job of a big company executive is very different from the job of a small company executive. Most of the work that I did was "incoming." In fact, most skilled big company executives will tell you that if you have more than three new initiatives in a quarter, you are trying to do too much. As a result, big company executives tend to be interrupt-driven.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>It's possible for an executive to be well liked and totally ineffective with respect to the other members of the team. It's also possible for an executive to be highly effective and profoundly influential while being totally despised. The latter is far better. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>For the final candidates, it's critically important that the CEO conduct the reference checks herself. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Consensus decisions about executives almost always sway the process away from strength and toward lack of weakness. Despite many people being involved in the process, the ultimate decision should be made solo.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>For many products, metrics often describe the customer acquisition goal in enough detail to provide sufficient management guidance. In contrast, the metrics for customer retention do not provide enough color to be a complete management tool. As a result, many young companies overemphasize retention metrics and do not spend enough time going deep enough on the actual user experience. This generally results in a frantic numbers chase that does not end in a great product. It's important to supplement a great product vision with a strong discipline around the metrics, but if you substitute metrics for product vision, you will not get what you want.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Like technical debt, management debt is incurred when you make an expedient, short-term management decision with an expensive, long-term consequence.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Here are three of the more popular types among startups.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Putting two in the box.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Overcompensating a key employee, because she gets another job offer.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>No performance management or employee feedback process.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>Every really good, really experienced CEO I know shares one important characteristic: They tend to opt for the hard answer to organizational issues.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>A CEO creates politics by encouraging and sometimes incentivizing political behavior--often unintentionally. As a very simple example, let's consider executive compensation. When you are CEO, senior employees will come to you from time to time and ask for an increase in compensation. This may sound innocent, but you have just created a strong incentive for political behavior. Specifically, you will be rewarding behavior that has nothing to do with advancing your business.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Build strict processes for potentially political issues and do not deviate. Certain activities attract political behavior. These activities include performance evaluation and compensation organizational design and territory, and promotions.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Every time your company gives someone a promotion, everyone else at that person's organizational level evaluates the promotion and judges whether merit or political favors yielded it. If the latter, then the other employees generally react in one of three ways.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>They sulk and feel undervalued. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>They outwardly disagree, campaign against the person, and undermine them in their new position. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>They attempt to copy the political behavior that generated the unwarranted promotion. </p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>As CEO, you must consider the systemic incentives that result from your words and actions. While it may feel good in the moment to be open, responsive, and action oriented, be careful not to encourage all the wrong things. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Nothing motivates a great employee more than a mission that's so important that it supersedes everyone's personal ambition. As a result, managers with the right kind of ambition tend to be radically more valuable than those with the wrong kind.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>When interviewing candidates, it's helpful to watch for small distinctions that indicate whether they view the world through the "me" prism or the "team" prism.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>One challenge is the Peter Principle. Coined by Dr. Laurence J. Peter and Raymond Hull in their 1969 book of that name, the Peter Principle holds that in a hierarchy, members are promoted so long as they work competently. Sooner or later they are promoted to a position at which they are no longer competent (their "level of incompetence"), and there they remain being unable to earn further promotions. As Andy Grove points out in his management classic High Output Management, the Peter Principle is unavoidable, because there is no way to know a priori at what level in the hierarchy a manager will be incompetent.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The Law of Crappy People states: For any title level in a large organization, the talent on that level will eventually converge to the crappiest person with the title. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The best way to mitigate both the Peter Principle and the Law of Crappy People is with a properly constructed and highly disciplined promotion process. To begin, start with an extremely crisp definition not only of the responsibilities at each level but also of the skill required to perform the duties. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Andreesen vs Zuck titles</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Andreessen argues that people ask for many things from a company: salary, bonus, stock options, span of control, and titles. Of those, title is by far the cheapest, so it makes sense to give the highest titles possible.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>At Facebook, by contrast, Mark Zuckerberg purposely deploys titles that are significantly lower than the industry standard. Why does he do this? First, he guarantees that every new employee gets releveled as they enter his company. In this way, he avoids accidentally giving new employees higher titles and positions than better-performing existing employees. This boosts morale and increases fairness. Second, it forces all the managers of Facebook to understand and internalize Facebook's leveling system, which serves the company extremely well in their own promotion and compensation processes. He also wants titles to be meaningful and reflect who has influence in the organization. As a company grows quickly, it's important to provide organizational clarity wherever possible and that gets more difficult if there are fifty VPs and ten Chiefs.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>Why hire a senior person? The short answer is time. As a technology startup, from the day you start until your last breath, you will be in a furious race against time. No technology startup has a long shelf life. Even the best ideas become terrible ideas after a certain age. How would Facebook go if Zuckerberg started it last week?</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The proper reason to hire a senior person is to acquire knowledge and experience in a specific area.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>One good test for determining whether to go with outside experience versus internal promotion is to figure out whether you value inside knowledge or outside knowledge more for the position. For example, for engineering managers the comprehensive knowledge of the code base and engineering team is usually more important and difficult to acquire than knowledge of how to run scalable engineering organizations. As a result, you might very well value the knowledge of your own organization more than that of the outside world. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>This is why when the head of engineering gets promoted from within, she often succeeds. When the head of sales gets promoted from within, she almost always fails. Asking yourself, "Do I value internal or external knowledge more for this position?" will help you determine whether to go for experience or youth.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>You should demand cultural compliance from executive hires. It's fine that people come from other company cultures. It's true that some of those cultures will have properties that are superior to your own. But this is your company, your culture, and your way of doing business. Do not be intimidated by experience on this issue; stick to your guns and stick to your culture.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Perhaps the CEO's most important operational responsibility is designing and implementing the communication architecture for her company. The architecture might include the organizational design, meetings, processes, email, yammer, and even one-on-one meetings with managers and employees.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The key to a good one-on-one meeting is the understanding that it is the employee's meeting rather than the manager's meeting. This is the free-form meeting for all the pressing issues, brilliant ideas, and chronic frustrations that do not fit neatly into status reports, email, and other less personal and intimate mechanisms. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Some questions that I've found to be very effective in one-on-ones.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>If we could improve in any way, how would we do it?</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>What's the number-one problem with our organization? Why?</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>What's not fun about working here? </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Who is really kicking ass in the company? Whom do you admire? </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>If you were me, what changes would you make? </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>What don't you like about the product? </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>What's the biggest opportunity that we're missing out on? </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>What are we not doing that we should be doing? </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Are you happy working here?</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>Ask ten founders about company culture and what it means and you'll get ten different answers.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The primary thing that any technology startup must do is build a product that's at least ten times better at doing something than the current prevailing way of doing that thing.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The second thing that any technology startup must do is to take the market. If it's possible to do something ten times better, it's also possible that you won't be the only company to figure that out. Therefore, you must take the market before somebody else does. Very few products are ten times better than the competition's, so unseating the new incumbent is much more difficult than unseating the old one.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Shock is a great mechanism for behavioral change. </p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Here are three examples: Desks made out of door. All desks at Amazon.com for all time would be built by buying cheap doors from Home Depot and nailing legs to them. These door desks are not great ergonomically, nor do they fit with Amazon.com's $150 billion-plus market capitalization, but when a shocked new employee asks why she must work on a makeshift desk constructed out of random Home Depot parts, the answer comes back with withering consistency: "We look for every opportunity to save money so that we can deliver the best products for the lowest cost.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Move fast and break things Mark Zuckerberg believes in innovation and he believes there can be no great innovation without great risk. So, in the early days of Facebook, he deployed a shocking motto: Move fast and break things.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>Dogs at work and yoga aren’t culture. Startups today do all kinds of things to distinguish themselves. Many great, many original, many quirky, but most of them will not define the company's culture.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>When an organization grows in size, things that were previously easy become difficult. Specifically, the following things that cause no trouble when you are small become big challenges as you grow: communication, common knowledge, decision making.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The first rule of organizational design is that all organizational designs are bad. With any design, you will optimize communication among some parts of the organization at the expense of other parts.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>When you get really big, you'll need to decide whether to organize the entire company around functions (for example, sales, marketing, product management, engineering) or around missions--self-contained business units that contain multiple functions.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Focus on the output first. What should the process produce? In the case of the interview process, an outstanding employee. If that's the goal, what's the process to get there?</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Engineer accountability into the system. Which organization and which individual is responsible for each step? What can you do to increase the visibility of their performance?</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>As CEO, you must constantly evaluate all the members of your team. However, evaluating people against the future needs of the company based on a theoretical view of how they will perform is counterproductive, for the following reasons.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Managing at scale is a learned skill rather than a natural ability. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>It's nearly impossible to make the judgment in advance.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>So, if you don't prejudge people's ability to scale, how do you make the judgment? You should evaluate your team at least once a quarter on all dimensions.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Perhaps the most important thing that I learned as an entrepreneur was to focus on what I needed to get right and stop worrying about all the things that I did wrong or might do wrong. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Seeing people fritter away money, waste each other's time, and do sloppy work can make you feel bad. If you are the CEO, it may well make you sick. And to rub salt into the wound and make matters worse, it's your fault.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Ideally, the CEO will be urgent yet not insane. She will move aggressively and decisively without feeling emotionally culpable. If she can separate the importance of the issues from how she feels about them, she will avoid demonizing her employees or herself. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>In your darkest moments as CEO, discussing fundamental questions about the viability of your company with your employees can have obvious negative consequences. On the other hand, talking to your board and outside advisers can be fruitless. The knowledge gap between you and them is so vast that you cannot actually bring them fully up to speed in a manner that's useful in making the decision. You are all alone.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>My friend Jason Rosenthal took over as CEO of Ning in 2010. As soon as he became CEO, he faced a cash crisis and had to choose among three difficult choices: (1) radically reduce the size of the company, (2) sell the company, or (3) raise money in a highly dilutive way. Choices like these cause migraine headaches. Tip to aspiring entrepreneurs: If you don't like choosing between horrible and cataclysmic, don't become CEO. At times like this, it's important to understand that nearly every company goes through life-threatening moments. My partner at Andreessen Horowitz, Scott Weiss, relayed that it's so common that there is an acronym for it, WFIO, which stands for "We're Fucked, It's Over" (it's pronounced "whiff-ee-yo"). As he describes it, every company goes through at least two and up to five of these episodes (although I'm pretty sure that I went through at least a dozen at Opsware). In all cases, WFIOs feel much worse than they are--especially for the CEO.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Techniques to calm nerves</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>"Make some friends. Although it's nearly impossible to get high-quality advice on the tough decisions that you make, it is extremely useful from a psychological perspective to talk to people who have been through similarly challenging decisions. Get it out of your head and onto paper. When I had to explain to my board that, since we were a public company, I thought that it would be best if we sold all of our customers and all of our revenue and changed business, it was messing with my mind. In order to finalize that decision, I wrote down a detailed explanation of my logic. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. The great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. They all say, "I didn't quit." </p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>People who watch you judge you on what you do, not how you feel.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>When my partners and I meet with entrepreneurs, the two key characteristics that we look for are brilliance and courage. In my experience as CEO, I found that the most important decisions tested my courage far more than my intelligence. The right decision is often obvious, but the pressure to make the wrong decision can be overwhelming. It starts with small things.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Intellectually, it should be clear that it is easier for employees to go to one decision maker than two. It's not really very complicated at all. Unfortunately, the clear and present social pressure often overwhelms the long-term benefits of organizing the company properly. Because the founders do not have the courage to decide who is in charge, every employee suffers the inconvenience of double approval.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>To make matters worse, when a CEO faces a particularly difficult decision, she may have only a slight preference for one choice over another--say 54 percent kill a product line, 46 percent keep it. If the really smart people on the board and on her staff take the other side, her courage will be severely tested. How can she kill the product when she is not even sure if she is making the right decision and everyone is against her? If she's wrong, she will have been wrong in the face of advice from her top advisers. If she is right, will anybody even know?</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Interestingly, as soon as Hamlet made the decision, the entire board and executive team immediately embraced the choice. Why? If they wanted to sell the company enough to advise the CEO to give up his dream, how could they reverse themselves so quickly? It turns out that the most important data point driving their earlier preference for selling the company was Hamlet's initial ambivalence--the team supported the decision they thought the CEO wanted. Hamlet did not realize this and interpreted their desire to sell to be the result of a thorough analysis. Luckily for everybody involved, he had the courage to make the right decision.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The general problem can be seen in the social credit matrix below. The expected social rewards for making the crowd-influenced decision appear better than those for making the decision you think is right.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>On the surface, it appears that if the decision is a close call, it's much safer to go with the crowd. In reality, if you fall into this trap, the crowd will influence your thinking and make a 70-30 decision seem like a 51-49 decision. This is why courage is critical. Every time you make the hard, correct decision you become a bit more courageous and every time you make the easy, wrong decision you become a bit more cowardly. If you are CEO, these choices will lead to a courageous or cowardly company.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Over the past ten years, technological advances have dramatically lowered the financial bar for starting a new company, but the courage bar for building a great company remains as high as it has ever been.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Jim Collins, in his bestselling book Good to Great, demonstrates through massive research and comprehensive analysis that when it comes to CEO succession, internal candidates dramatically outperform external candidates. The core reason is knowledge. Knowledge of technology, prior decisions, culture, personnel, and more tends to be far more difficult to acquire than the skills required to manage a larger organization. Collins does not, however, explain why internal candidates sometimes fail as well. I will attempt to do so here. I will focus the discussion on two core skills for running an organization: First, knowing what to do. Second, getting the company to do what you know. While being a great CEO requires both skills, most CEOs tend to be more comfortable with one or the other. I call managers who are happier setting the direction of the company Ones and those who more enjoy making the company perform at the highest level Twos.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>If you're a One, it can be counterproductive to have another One on your staff, because she will want to set her own direction rather than follow yours. This kind of strategic contention can confuse the organization and send employees in opposing directions. As a result, many great One CEOs employ primarily Twos and Functional Ones on their staff.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>CEO transition is hard. If you bring people in from the outside, you lower your chances for success. If you promote from within, you must deal with the One-Two phenomenon. Ideally, you'll promote a One and the rest of the executive team will be glad you did. Too bad things are rarely ideal.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>Most people define leadership in the same way that Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart famously defined pornography when he said, "I know it when I see it." For our purposes, we can generalize this to be the measure of the quality of a leader: the quantity, quality, and diversity of people who want to follow her.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>So what makes people want to follow a leader? We look for three key traits: The ability to articulate the vision, the right kind of ambition, the ability to achieve the vision.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Truly great leaders create an environment where the employees feel that the CEO cares more about the employees than she cares about herself.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>He said, "There are lots of good peacetime CEOs and lots of good wartime CEOs, but almost no CEOs that can function in both peacetime and in wartime. You're a peacetime/wartime CEO.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Peacetime in business means those times when a company has a large advantage over the competition in its core market, and its market is growing. In times of peace, the company can focus on expanding the market and reinforcing the company's strengths. In wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat. Such a threat can come from a wide range of sources, including competition, dramatic macroeconomic change, market change, supply chain change, and so forth.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>In peacetime, leaders must maximize and broaden the current opportunity. As a result, peacetime leaders employ techniques to encourage broad-based creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives. In wartime, by contrast, the company typically has a single bullet in the chamber and must, at all costs, hit the target. The company's survival in wartime depends upon strict adherence and alignment to the mission. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the company was weeks away from bankruptcy--a classic wartime scenario. He needed everyone to move with precision and follow his exact plan; there was no room for individual creativity outside the core mission. In stark contrast, as Google achieved dominance in the search market, Google's management fostered peacetime innovation by enabling and even requiring every employee to spend 20 percent of their time on their own new projects.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Be aware that management books tend to be written by management consultants who study successful companies during their times of peace. As a result, the resulting books describe the methods of peacetime CEOs. In fact, other than the books written by Andy Grove, I don't know of any management books that teach you how to manage in wartime like Steve Jobs or Andy Grove.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>From an evolutionary standpoint, it is natural to do things that make people like you. It enhances your chances for survival. Yet to be a good CEO, in order to be liked in the long run, you must do many things that will upset people in the short run. Unnatural things.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>A popular and sometimes effective technique for feedback beginners is something that experienced managers call the Shit Sandwich.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>The basic idea is that people open up to feedback far more if you start by complimenting them (slice of bread number one), then you give them the difficult message (the shit), then wrap up by reminding them how much you value their strengths (slice of bread number two). The shit sandwich also has the positive side effect of focusing the feedback on the behavior rather than the person, because you establish up front that you really value the person. This is a key concept in giving feedback.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The shit sandwich can work well with junior employees but has the following challenges: It tends to be overly formal. Because you have to preplan and script the sandwich to make it come out correctly, the process can feel formal and judgmental to the employee. After you do it a couple of times, it will lack authenticity. The employee will think, "Oh boy, she's complimenting me again. I know what's coming next, the shit." More senior executives will recognize the shit sandwich immediately and it will have an instant negative effect.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>By describing how I evaluate CEOs, I am at the same time describing what I think the job of the CEO is. Here are the key questions we ask: Does the CEO know what to do? Can the CEO get the company to do what she knows? Did the CEO achieve the desired results against an appropriate set of objectives? </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>In good companies, the story and the strategy are the same thing. As a result, the proper output of all the strategic work is the story. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The story of the company goes beyond quarterly or annual goals and gets to the hard-core question of why. Why should I join this company? Why should I be excited to work here? Why should I buy its product? Why should I invest in the company? Why is the world better off as a result of this company's existence?</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The very next day I informed the head of Sales Engineering and the head of Customer Support that they would be switching jobs. I explained that, like Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris, they would keep their minds, but get new bodies. Permanently. Their initial reactions were not unlike the remake where Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis both scream in horror. However, after just one week walking in the other's moccasins, both executives quickly diagnosed the core issues causing the conflict.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>To make matters worse, executives who start off world-class often deteriorate over time. If you are a sports fan, you know that world-class athletes don't stay world-class for long. One day you are Terrell Owens and the next day you are Terrell Owens. While executives don't age nearly as fast as athletes do, companies, markets, and technologies change a thousand times faster than the game of football. As a result, the executive who is spectacular in this year's hundred-person startup may be washed-up in next year's version when the company employs four hundred people and has $100 million in revenue.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The task would be far simpler if there were no emotion involved. But selling your company is always emotional and deeply personal. For the purpose of this discussion, it is useful to think about technology acquisitions in three categories: talent/technology, product, business.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>When analyzing whether you should sell your company, a good basic rule of thumb is if (a) you are very early on in a very large market and (b) you have a good chance of being number one in that market, then you should remain stand-alone.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>One way to avoid these traps is to describe the analysis in the prior section: If the company achieves product-market fit in a very large market and has an excellent chance to be number one, then the company will likely remain independent. If not, it will likely be sold. This is one good method to describe the interests of the investors in a way that's not at odds with the interests of the employees, and it is true.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>Marc and I thought that if we created a firm specifically designed to help technical founders run their own companies, we could develop a reputation and a brand that might vault us into the top tier of venture capital firms despite having no track record. We identified two key deficits that a founder CEO had when compared with a professional CEO.</p>

	</li>
	<ul>
	<li><p>The CEO skill set Managing executives, organizational design, running sales organizations and the like were all important skills that technical founders lacked. </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>The CEO network Professional CEOs knew lots of executives, potential customers and partners, people in the press, investors, and other important business connections.</p>

	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>After eight years of running Loudcloud and Opsware, I had learned so many hard lessons that building the team was easy. I understood the importance of hiring for strength rather than for lack of weakness, and I understood the meaning of "fit." There are lots of smart people in the world, but smart is not good enough. I needed people who were great where I needed greatness.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Of course, even with all the advice and hindsight in the world, hard things will continue to be hard things. So, in closing, I just say peace to all those engaged in the struggle to fulfill their dreams.</p>
