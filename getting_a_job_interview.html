      Many people have asked me for advice about breaking into the tech industry in Silicon Valley. Here are some tips that will help you land interviews. Most of them are applicable to other industries and places as well. 

      <br><br>

      <b>Reach out to the right people</b>
      <br>
      You always want to reach out to people that work in the function that you’re interested in. So if you want an engineering job, reach out to engineers. If you want a designer job, reach out to designers. It’s also better to contact people that have a more senior position than the one you’re applying for.  

      <br><br>

      It’s better to contact these people because they can actually get you an interview. Recruiters don’t have much power when it comes to interview decisions. They probably won’t even forward your resume to the team lead unless you have a star company (Google, etc.) or star school (Stanford, etc.) on your resume. And recruiters at top companies get hundreds of messages per week. You don’t want to compete with all those people. Much fewer people go the direct route. 

      <br><br>

      I won’t discuss finding good companies here. But once you have a list of companies, the best way to find people that fit the above description is to use LinkedIn.   

      <br><br>

      <b>Figure out email addresses</b>
      <br>
      Once you know who you want to contact, you will want to figure out their email. Luckily, there are some hacks you can use to figure out almost anyone’s email. On LinkedIn, you’ll sometimes find the right person but their last name is hidden.  If that’s the case, Google their first name, job title, and company. The first Google result will almost always include the full name.

      <br><br>

      Now that you know the full name and company, download a Gmail application called Rapportive. The app lets you guess the email of a person and show you if you guessed correctly by cross-checking account registrations on different social networks. Since there are only a few common email combinations (johnsmith@company.com, jsmith@company.com, john@company.com, etc.), I can usually get someone’s email in less than 30 seconds. There are some advanced techniques and searching “Rapportive email search” will give you plenty of useful links. [1]

      <br><br>

      <b>Don’t waste time</b>
      <br>
      People almost universally hate long emails and appreciate conciseness. Since you’re using a work email, being brief is even more important. I would try to have less than 5 sentences total and use the last sentence to ask for a 10min phone call. The benefit of a phone discussion is that it’s much easier to convey a lot of information quickly. The other person will appreciate this too since long back-and-forth email discussions suck.

      <br><br>

      The only things I would put in the email are my name, program/school, experience and projects (2 sentences), reason for interest (1 sentence), and an ask for a phone call (1 sentence). I would be direct in the subject line so something like “[Role] interested in [position] at [company]. Have 10min to chat?” is good. 

      <br><br>

      <b>The phone call</b>
      <br>

      During the phone call, pitch yourself but also ask questions to keep the conversation balanced. I’ve had initial phone calls turn into interviews so be prepared. If the call went well and you’re looking to start work soon, you should be direct and ask about the interview process at the end of the call. If the call went well and you don’t plan to start for some months, you should build a relationship and ask if you can follow up (another call, coffee, etc.) in some time. If there isn’t a good fit between you and the company, you should ask the person if he has any contacts that he thinks you should reach out to. You don’t have anything to lose and introductions from someone in the industry are important. Regardless of the response, send out a quick thank you email the next day. 

      <br><br>

      <b>Breadth and depth</b>
      <br>
      There are many amazing companies and the above method is quick. When people tell me they haven’t heard back from the 7 people the emailed they aren’t doing it right. There is no reason not to email 100+ people. [2] Even if they don’t all get you interviews, phone discussions and email responses are still helpful. When I went through this process I made a spreadsheet with learnings from each phone call.  

      <br><br>

      You should email many people but not at the expense of being generic. In each email you should state exactly why you’re interested in the particular company. Good reasons usually relate to the mission of the company or the team. 

      <br><br><br>

      <br>

      [2] If you have strong experience and already work in the industry, this is overkill. But if you’re a student from a non-target school that wants to work in another country, it’s a numbers game. There is nothing wrong with 500+ emails. 

      <br><br>
