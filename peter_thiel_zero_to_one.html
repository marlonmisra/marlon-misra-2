    <h3 style="margin-top:0px">Peter Thiel - Zero to one</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Summary</h4>

	<p class='v-project-description'>
	Thiel writes about his world beliefs with a focus on startups and entrepreneurship. In the first chapters, he suggests that there are two types of growth - vertical growth (technology) and horizontal growth (globalization). He argues that vertical growth is more important because technology results in humanity getting more for less. In contrast, horizontal growth is merely copying. If the entire world only relied on horizontal progress, we would eventually reach a static state. I think it’s important to think about the two types of growth as distinct but I still think that horizontal growth is extremely important. If every country caught up to the USA then we would be in a much better place.

	<br><br>

	He goes on to explain that negative perceptions of monopolies are often unjustified. Many economics students learn that perfect competition is a preferred state because monopolies control prices, make large profits, and generally screw consumers. However, the statement is only true in an economy where nothing changes. In reality, creative monopolies create value where it didn’t exist before. In any case, from the entrepreneur's perspective you should always aim for monopoly. With monopoly profits, a company can afford to treat employees better, invest in more R&D, and generally be in a better position. In order to actually start a future monopoly business, you have to start in sufficiently small and growing market. Doing this ensures less competition from big players which is key. Facebook, for example, did this by initially focusing on a single university. 

	<br><br>

	Thiel tries to categorize countries’ mindsets on a simple 2x2 matrix with definitiness and optimism scales. Today, China has definite pessimism because they have too many people and are merely copying other states. Europe has indefinite pessimism because they are not innovating and don’t know what to do about it. Thiel says this is why they barely work and love vacations. The US in the 1950 and 1960 had definite optimism because they just won World War 2 and invested heavily in the Internet, space technology, etc. The US today has indefinite optimism. We expect things to get better because our parents grew up during a time where it seemed to happen automatically. In order to have definite optimism again, we have to plan better and believe in a definite future. What we don’t need more of is bankers or consultants. Ivy-league graduates jump to these careers because they seek optionality. Once they start their jobs, they diversify again because they don’t know what the future entails. Well-roundedness, I believe, is vastly overrated and Thiel seems to agree by refering to it as “seeking optionality”.  

	<br><br>

	Successful startups have 4 main traits: proprietary technology, economies of scale, network effects, and a strong brand. In addition, Thiel offers a set of questions every entrepreneur should answer: the technology question, monopoly question, team question, time question, durability question, and the distribution question. Successful startups should aim to be the last mover in a market because then the company can sustain profits.  

	<br><br>

	Thiel also offers tactical suggestions for startup CEOs. Real technologists shouldn’t wear suits because they don’t need to fake the illusion of knowledge. Early on, CEOs should give each person unique responsibilities to make decision-making faster. They should take a low salary because it incentives long-term thinking and sets an example for others. They should be stealthy and avoid media because this only attracts competition. CEOs should create a mission-oriented cult-like atmosphere where everyone is extremely passionate about the goal. Public image should be taken seriously and one way to do that is to think about it early. The most important lesson for entrepreneurs is to reason from the ground up and think from first principles. World-changing discoveries are secrets that will only be found that way.  

  <br><br>

  In the near future, Thiel beliefs that most value will come from technology companies that work at the intersection of computers and humans. His belief stems from the fact that humans and machines are good at opposite things (intentionality and creativity vs. data analysis). Thiel is optimistic about the near term because machines don’t compete with humans for resources or employment. In the long term, Thiel beliefs in one of two outcomes: The first is strong AI that kills us all and the second is utopia where machines act as the ultimate compliment of humans.

    <h4>Highlights</h4>

	<ul class='v-project-description'>

  <li><p>Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Technology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental capabilities to a higher level. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily cannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe in concrete terms how to be innovative.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: "What important truth do very few people agree with you on? A good answer takes the following form: "Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x. My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>For example, 1815 to 1914 was a period of both rapid technological development and rapid globalization. Between the First World War and Kissinger's trip to reopen relations with China in 1971, there was rapid technological development but not much globalization. Since 1971, we have seen rapid globalization along with limited technological development, mostly confined to IT. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Only computers and communications have improved dramatically since midcentury. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Bureaucratic hierarchies move slowly, and entrenched interests shy away from risk. In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if this describes your company, you should quit now).</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Conventional beliefs only ever come to appear arbitrary and wrong in retrospect; whenever one collapses, we call the old belief a bubble. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The Mosaic browser was officially released in November 1993, giving regular people a way to get online. Mosaic became Netscape, which released its Navigator browser in late 1994.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Dot-com mania was intense but short - 18 months of insanity from September 1998 to March 2000. Everyone learned to treat the future as fundamentally indefinite, and to dismiss as an extremist anyone with plans big enough to be measured in years instead of quarters. Globalization replaced technology as the hope for the future. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>These lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would ignore them are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great crash of 2000. And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct: 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality. 2. A bad plan is better than no plan. 3. Competitive markets destroy profits. 4. Sales matters just as much as product. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>We still need new technology, and we may even need some 1999-style hubris and exuberance to get it.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Creating value is not enough - you also need to capture some of the value you create. For example, U.S. airline companies serve millions of passengers and create hundreds of billions of dollars of value each year. But in 2012, when the average airfare each way was $178, the airlines made only 37 cents per passenger trip. Compare them to Google, which creates less value but captures far more. Google brought in $50 billion in 2012 (versus $160 billion for the airlines), but it kept 21% of those revenues as profits--more than 100 times the airline industry's profit margin that year. Google makes so much money that it's now worth three times more than every U.S. airline combined.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Perfect competition is considered both the ideal and the default state in Economics 101. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The confusion comes from a universal bias for describing market conditions in self-serving ways: both monopolists and competitors are incentivized to bend the truth.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything. Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can't. In perfect competition, a business is so focused on today's margins that it can't possibly plan for a long-term future. Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>So, a monopoly is good for everyone on the inside, but what about everyone on the outside? Do outsized profits come at the expense of the rest of society? Actually, yes: profits come out of customers' wallets, and monopolies deserve their bad reputation - but only in a world where nothing changes.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Even the government knows this: that's why one of its departments works hard to create monopolies (by granting patents to new inventions) even though another part hunts them down (by prosecuting antitrust cases).</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>So why are economists obsessed with competition as an ideal state? It's a relic of history. Economists copied their mathematics from the work of 19th-century physicists: they see individuals and businesses as interchangeable atoms, not as unique creators. Their theories describe an equilibrium state of perfect competition because that's what's easy to model, not because it represents the best of business.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>In the real world outside economic theory, every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others cannot. Monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an exception. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>And it gets worse as students ascend to higher levels of the tournament. Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking. For the privilege of being turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation. Why are we doing this to ourselves? </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Rivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what has worked in the past.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>If you can't beat a rival, it may be better to merge. I started Confinity with my co-founder Max Levchin in 1998. When we released the PayPal product in late 1999, Elon Musk's X.com was right on our heels: our companies' offices were four blocks apart on University Avenue in Palo Alto, and X's product mirrored ours feature-for-feature.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Sometimes you do have to fight. Where that's true, you should fight and win. There is no middle ground: either don't throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Most of a tech company's value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the future.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>For a company to be valuable it must grow and endure, but many entrepreneurs focus only on short-term growth. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>What does a company with large cash flows far into the future look like? Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Groupon posted fast growth as hundreds of thousands of local businesses tried their product. But persuading those businesses to become repeat customers was harder than they thought. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>You can also make a 10x improvement through superior integrated design. Design improvements are hard to measure, but it seems clear that Apple improved on anything that had come before by at least an order of magnitude: tablets went from unusable to useful.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Network effects can be powerful, but you'll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small. Paradoxically, then, network effects businesses must start with especially small markets. This is why successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don't even appear to be business opportunities at all.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>A monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger: the fixed costs of creating a product (engineering, management, office space) can be spread out over ever greater quantities of sales.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>It's always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. Amazon shows how it can be done. Jeff Bezos's founding vision was to dominate all of online retail, but he very deliberately started with books. Sequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to expand gradually. The most successful companies make the core progression--to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets--a part of their founding narrative.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don't disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn't do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you. It's much better to be the last mover - that is, to make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years or even decades of monopoly profits.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>You can expect the future to take a definite form or you can treat it as hazily uncertain. If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you'll give up on trying to master it. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>A definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it "well-roundedness," a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive--to be a monopoly of one. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Europeans just react to events as they happen and hope things don't get worse. The indefinite pessimist can't know whether the inevitable decline will be fast or slow, catastrophic or gradual. All he can do is wait for it to happen, so he might as well eat, drink, and be merry in the meantime: hence Europe's famous vacation mania.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>A definite pessimist believes the future can be known, but since it will be bleak, he must prepare for it. Perhaps surprisingly, China is probably the most definitely pessimistic place in the world today. When Americans see the Chinese economy grow ferociously fast (10% per year since 2000), we imagine a confident country mastering its future. But that's because Americans are still optimists, and we project our optimism onto China. China can grow so fast only because its starting base is so low. The easiest way for China to grow is to relentlessly copy what has already worked in the West. But with a huge population pushing resource prices higher, there's no way Chinese living standards can ever actually catch up to those of the richest countries, and the Chinese know it.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better. From the 17th century through the 1950s and '60s, definite optimists led the Western world. Scientists, engineers, doctors, and businessmen made the world richer, healthier, and more long-lived than previously imaginable. After a brief pessimistic phase in the 1970s, indefinite optimism has dominated American thinking ever since 1982, when a long bull market began and finance eclipsed engineering as the way to approach the future. To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn't know how exactly, so he won't make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely. Instead of working for years to build a new product, indefinite optimists rearrange already-invented ones. Bankers make money by rearranging the capital structures of already existing companies. Lawyers resolve disputes over old things or help other people structure their affairs. And private equity investors and management consultants don't start new businesses; they squeeze extra efficiency from old ones with incessant procedural optimizations. It's no surprise that these fields all attract disproportionate numbers of high-achieving Ivy League optionality chasers; what could be a more appropriate reward for two decades of resume-building than a seemingly elite, process-oriented career that promises to "keep options open"? </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Technological advance seemed to accelerate automatically, so the Boomers grew up with great expectations but few specific plans for how to fulfill them. Then, when technological progress stalled in the 1970s, increasing income inequality came to the rescue of the most elite Boomers. Every year of adulthood continued to get automatically better and better for the rich and successful. The rest of their generation was left behind, but the wealthy Boomers who shape public opinion today see little reason to question their naive optimism. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>While a definitely optimistic future would need engineers to design underwater cities and settlements in space, an indefinitely optimistic future calls for more bankers and lawyers. Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it's the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth. If they don't go to law school, bright college graduates head to Wall Street precisely because they have no real plan for their careers. And once they arrive at Goldman, they find that even inside finance, everything is indefinite. It's still optimistic--you wouldn't play in the markets if you expected to lose--but the fundamental tenet is that the market is random; you can't know anything specific or substantive; diversification becomes supremely important.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>At no point does anyone in the chain know what to do with money in the real economy. But in an indefinite world, people actually prefer unlimited optionality; money is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it. Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The indefiniteness of finance can be bizarre. Think about what happens when successful entrepreneurs sell their company. What do they do with the money? In a financialized world, it unfolds like this: The founders don't know what to do with it, so they give it to a large bank. The bankers don't know what to do with it, so they diversify by spreading it across a portfolio of institutional investors. Institutional investors don't know what to do with their managed capital, so they diversify by amassing a portfolio of stocks. Companies try to increase their share price by generating free cash flows. If they do, they issue dividends or buy back shares and the cycle repeats.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Forget "minimum viable products"--ever since he started Apple in 1976, Jobs saw that you can change the world through careful planning, not by listening to focus group feedback or copying others' successes. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>But in a weird way it's not nearly enough, because Andreessen Horowitz has a $1.5 billion fund: if they only wrote $250,000 checks, they would need to find 19 Instagrams just to break even. This is why investors typically put a lot more money into any company worth funding. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Whenever you shift from the substance of a business to the financial question of whether or not it fits into a diversified hedging strategy, venture investing starts to look a lot like buying lottery tickets. And once you think that you're playing the lottery, you've already psychologically prepared yourself to lose. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The same reason that so many internet companies, including Facebook, are often underestimated - their very simplicity - is itself an argument for secrets. If insights that look so elementary in retrospect can support important and valuable businesses, there must remain many great companies still to start. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>When you start something, the first and most crucial decision you make is whom to start it with. Choosing a co-founder is like getting married, and founder conflict is just as ugly as divorce. Optimism abounds at the start of every relationship.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Founders should share a prehistory before they start a company together--otherwise they're just rolling dice.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>In the boardroom, less is more. The smaller the board, the easier it is for the directors to communicate, to reach consensus, and to exercise effective oversight. However, that very effectiveness means that a small board can forcefully oppose management in any conflict. This is why it's crucial to choose wisely: every single member of your board matters. Even one problem director will cause you pain, and may even jeopardize your company's future. A board of three is ideal. Your board should never exceed five people, unless your company is publicly held. (Government regulations effectively mandate that public companies have larger boards--the average is nine members.) </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Whenever an entrepreneur asks me to invest in his company, I ask him how much he intends to pay himself. A company does better the less it pays the CEO - that's one of the single clearest patterns I've noticed from investing in hundreds of startups. In no case should a CEO of an early-stage, venture-backed startup receive more than $150,000 per year in salary. High pay incentivizes him to defend the status quo along with his salary, not to work with everyone else to surface problems and fix them aggressively. A cash-poor executive, by contrast, will focus on increasing the value of the company as a whole.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Equity is the one form of compensation that can effectively orient people toward creating value in the future. Anyone who prefers owning a part of your company to being paid in cash reveals a preference for the long term and a commitment to increasing your company's value in the future. Equity can't create perfect incentives, but it's the best way for a founder to keep everyone in the company broadly aligned.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The only good answers are specific to your company, so you won't find them in this book. But there are two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team. You'll attract the employees you need if you can explain why your mission is compelling: not why it's important in general, but why you're doing something important that no one else is going to get done. Just cover the basics like health insurance and then promise what no others can: the opportunity to do irreplaceable work on a unique problem alongside great people.</p>

  <li><p>The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The best startups might be considered slightly less extreme kinds of cults. The biggest difference is that cults tend to be fanatically wrong about something important. People at a successful startup are fanatically right about something those outside it have missed. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Like acting, sales works best when hidden. This explains why almost everyone whose job involves distribution--whether they're in sales, marketing, or advertising--has a job title that has nothing to do with those things. People who sell advertising are called "account executives." People who sell customers work in "business development." People who sell companies are "investment bankers." And people who sell themselves are called "politicians.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Two metrics set the limits for effective distribution. The total net profit that you earn on average over the course of your relationship with a customer (Customer Lifetime Value, or CLV) must exceed the amount you spend on average to acquire a new customer (Customer Acquisition Cost, or CAC).</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>People have intentionality - we form plans and make decisions in complicated situations. Computers are exactly the opposite: they excel at efficient data processing, but they struggle to make basic judgments that would be simple for any human.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>But the most valuable companies in the future won't ask what problems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they'll ask: how can computers help humans solve hard problems? </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Technology is supposed to increase our mastery over nature and reduce the role of chance in our lives; building smarter-than-human computers could actually bring chance back with a vengeance. Strong AI is like a cosmic lottery ticket: if we win, we get utopia; if we lose, Skynet substitutes us out of existence. Indefinite fears about the far future shouldn't stop us from making definite plans today.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Most cleantech companies crashed because they neglected one or more of the seven questions that every business must answer: 1. The Engineering Question Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements? 2. The Timing Question Is now the right time to start your particular business? 3. The Monopoly Question Are you starting with a big share of a small market? 4. The People Question Do you have the right team? 5. The Distribution Question Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product? 6. The Durability Question Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? 7. The Secret Question Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Exaggerating your own uniqueness is an easy way to botch the monopoly question.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>At Founders Fund, we saw this coming. The most obvious clue was sartorial: cleantech executives were running around wearing suits and ties. This was a huge red flag, because real technologists wear T-shirts and jeans. So we instituted a blanket rule: pass on any company whose founders dressed up for pitch meetings.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Social entrepreneurs aim to combine the best of both worlds and "do well by doing good." Usually they end up doing neither.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The lesson for business is that we need founders. If anything, we should be more tolerant of founders who seem strange or extreme; we need unusual individuals to lead companies beyond mere incrementalism. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better--to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future. </p></li>
