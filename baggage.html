    <h3 style="margin-top:0px"> Baggage </h3>
    <p class='v-project-description'>
      Every day we worry about things. Some things are important but most don’t matter. I call the things that don’t really matter “baggage”. These are the things that steal our time and cloud our minds. We carry them with us but they’re really just weight on our shoulders. Two months ago I graduated from school and was packing for a backpacking trip around Asia. I had to decide what I wanted to keep and what I wanted to sell or donate. To my surprise, in the end I got rid of 95% of the things I own. Everything I still have is in a 50L backpack. [1] I’ve already decided I’m going to donate most of that too when I finish my trip. 

      <br><br>

      I think it’s worth everyone’s time to think about ways to reduce baggage. My example is extreme, but I think the exercise will still be valuable. Most people vastly overestimate how many things they need. I’ll first give a few examples of baggage, and then I’ll explain how getting rid of it improved my life. 

      <br><br>

      <u>People</u>
      <br>
      I immigrated 5 times and attended 7 schools before starting college. Because of those experiences, I’ve always found it easy to make new friends. At the same time, I also got used to losing friends quickly. In high school I knew almost everyone but only had few close friends. Now I aim to do the opposite. I think deeply about who I want to be close with and invest all my time in those relationships. Now most of the people I spend time with are really good friends. I tell them my secrets and share the things I’m vulnerable about. They reciprocate and we learn a lot from each other. These deep relationships have been much more rewarding. Close lasting friendships matter. Acquaintances make us worry, take our time, and aren’t rewarding for either side. [2] Acquaintances are baggage.      

      <br><br>

      <u>Things</u>
      <br>
      The problem with material things is that they don’t provide a sustainable source of happiness. This is the case because you don’t form deep connections with stuff. When you buy a new shirt you just put down $20 and get it. But if you learn something new, you might invest hundreds of hours and the reward is understanding. If you learn a new language, you’ll know new grammatical structures, new sounds, and gain appreciation for a completely different culture. Stuff just isn’t deep like that. Stuff provides short-term artificial happiness that needs to be renewed constantly to work. It’s this unfortunate self-reinforcing cycle that creates baggage.  

      <br><br>

      Think about whether you really need or want the things you own. If the answer is no, just give those things away. It will clear your mind and help you focus. You will have more freedom and feel more mobile. If you ever want to relocate to a new city, travel, or do anything else it will be easier.

      <br><br>

      <u>Miscellaneous</u>
      <br>
      Pay off your loans as quickly as possible so that your lenders don’t control you. Get an unlocked phone so that you don’t have to give in to silly carrier restrictions when you move. Put your files on Dropbox so that you don’t have to rely on a local backup. Don’t book all your flights ahead of time so that you maintain flexibility. These things are simple but they all have the same effect. They reduce baggage. 

      <br><br>

      <b>Conclusion</b>
      <br>

      I want to spend my time with awesome friends, discuss crazy ideas, try new experiments, learn new things, travel around the world, and so on. I don’t want to write “Happy birthday!” on five people’s Facebook wall every day, clean up my room all the time, or worry about the sale that ends in a few hours for the shirt I’ll wear twice. 

      <br><br><br>

      [1] Dropbox owns my digital stuff (photos, videos, documents). My parents own childhood toys and things like that.    

      <br>

      [2] I’m not saying that meeting new people is bad. Diverse friends challenge you and breed creativity. That is good. What I am saying, simply put, is that a couple of amazing friends is better than many average ones. If you meet someone cool, don’t be afraid to open up. 

      <br><br>
