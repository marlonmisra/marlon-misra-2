    <h3 style="margin-top:0px">Walter Isaacson - Benjamin Franklin</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Summary</h4>

	<p class='v-project-description'>
	During Benjamin Franklin’s life, he was America’s best diplomat, scientist, writer, businessman, and political thinker. It’s hard to think of anyone alive today that has such diverse talents. I think the main reason is that it now takes many years of specialization to push boundaries in any field. People nowadays are also more conservative. It's easy to view problems as solved or unsolvable and then not make the effort to try.

	<br><br>

	Franklin’s two core principles were industry and frugality because in his words they are means of procuring wealth and securing virtue. Securing virtue through frugality makes sense to me. Being frugal lets you avoid entering a cycle of chasing things you don’t want. 

	<br><br>

	One of his most admirable traits was his obsession with self-improvement. Franklin would read essays, take notes, set them aside, and try to recreate the essay in his own words. I’m doing the same thing as I write this and the benefits are clear. When you only read a book you don’t engage deeply with the material and forget most of it. When you follow Franklin’s steps you store more knowledge in memory, relate better to other concepts, and think of new ideas more effectively. Franklin also made lists of virtues and deliberately set time aside to work on each one. Again, I’ve noticed that doing this is effective because it takes deliberate effort over long time periods to adopt new habits or lose bad ones. 

	<br><br>

	In addition to self-improvement, Franklin nurtured his reputation for pride and utility purposes. He realized that people are more likely to admire your work if you can keep them from feeling jealous. He noted that you can become more revered by displaying self-deprecating humor, unpretentious demeanor, and unaggressive style in conversation. I’ve noticed these things work really well too. The simplest way to do this is to take blame for bad things and give credit for good things. It also helps to be a really good listener. Everyone likes people that listen.  

	<br><br>

	Another recurring theme in Franklin’s life was pragmatism. Franklin always worked on the most impactful things of the time, regardless of how different they were. He poked fun at professions of faith because they didn’t serve any worldly purpose. Franklin also wanted to be useful after death. He accomplished this by designating $2,000 as loans for apprenticeships.  

  <br><br>

  Franklin’s diplomatic and Socratic techniques proved successful with America’s alliance with France and treaty with England. When he was young, he did mock debates and learned that being less contentious and confrontational had many benefits. In arguments, he would ask innocent questions and draw people into making concessions, which would gradually prove the point he was trying to make. During conferences, his tone of moderation and absence of one-sided advocacy led to creative compromise. Asking questions to get someone to agree with you is so counterintuitive that it’s hard to practice. I think this is an effective method when you don’t have time constraints.

  <br><br>

  Franklin’s economic conservatism was balanced by his moral belief that actions should be judged by how much they benefit the common good. He thought that people who acquired more wealth than needed had a duty to help those in genuine need and to create civic institutions. But those who couldn’t pull their weight from a lack of virtue should not receive help from society. I think I’m in favor of moderate welfare expenditures. You want to help those who really need it and want to limit exploiters as much as possible. Otherwise things stop being fair for everyone. It would be interesting to look at studies of pre-welfare and post-welfare countries to see how effective government programs are. 

  <br><br>

  Franklin was dubious of populism and inheritance. These beliefs were interwoven in the 1776 Declaration Of Independence and the 1777 Articles Of Confederation. I really don’t like inheritances. So many people get a massive head start without doing any work. Because of that, they often exhibit entitlement.  All things considered, I don’t know how you would fix inheritance in a way that most people would agree. Life is unfair. 

  <br><br>

  Franklin was a strong believer in social mobility and resistance to authority. He believed that rights and power should be based on merit and hard work and not the results of heritage. The trait ‘resistance to authority’ seems to be present in most successful people. Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, etc. I keep seeing it in biographies.

  <br><br>

  The most interesting historical note in the biography is related to the Senate and House of Representatives. Because small states and large states kept arguing over money and liberties, a dual system was agreed upon. The House gives power to large states who are concerned with financials. The Senate gives power to small states who are worried about liberties. In order to pass any bill, the House and Senate have to accept the proposal. The two-system decision has proven incredibly successful and Franklin played an important part in implementing it.

  <h4>Highlights</h4>

	<ul class='v-project-description'>

  <li><p>He was, during his eighty-four-year-long life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical, though not most profound, political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He devised bifocal glasses and clean-burning stoves, charts of the Gulf Stream and theories about the contagious nature of the common cold. He launched various civic improvement schemes, such as a lending library, college, volunteer fire corps, insurance association, and matching grant fund-raiser. He helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor and philosophical pragmatism. In foreign policy, he created an approach that wove together idealism with balance-of-power realism. And in politics, he proposed seminal plans for uniting the colonies and creating a federal model for a national government.</p></li>

  <li><p>His morality was built on a sincere belief in leading a virtuous life, serving the country he loved, and hoping to achieve salvation through good works.</p></li>

  <li><p>The strong yet pragmatic independence of Thomas Franklin, along with his clever ingenuity, seems to have been passed down through four generations. The family produced dissenters and nonconformists who were willing to defy authority, although not to the point of becoming zealots.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>For some people, the most important formative element is place. To appreciate Harry Truman, for example, you must understand the Missouri frontier of the nineteenth century; likewise, you must delve into the Hill Country of Texas to fathom Lyndon Johnson.3 But Benjamin Franklin was not so rooted. His heritage was that of a person without place - the youngest sons of middle-class artisans--most of whom made their careers in towns different from those of their fathers. He is thus best understood as a product of lineage rather than of land. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>And thus the Puritan migration established the foundation for some characteristics of Benjamin Franklin, and of America itself: a belief that spiritual salvation and secular success need not be at odds, that industriousness is next to godliness, and that free thought and free enterprise are integrally related.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Displaying the robust resistance to authority that ran in both the Folger and Franklin families, Peter was the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Enchanted by the device, he gave up all the coins in his pocket for it. His siblings proceeded to ridicule him, saying he had paid four times what it was worth. "I cried with vexation," Franklin recalled, "and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure." Frugality became for him not only a virtue but also a pleasure. "Industry and frugality," he wrote in describing the theme of Poor Richard's almanacs, are "the means of procuring wealth and thereby securing virtue.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>But after two years, James lost the contract to print the Gazette, and he did something quite audacious. He launched what was then the only truly independent newspaper in the colonies and the first with literary aspirations.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>As a result of his mock debates with Collins, Franklin began to tailor for himself a persona that was less contentious and confrontational, which made him seem endearing and charming as he grew older--or, to a small but vocal cadre of enemies, manipulative and conniving.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>By asking what seemed to be innocent questions, Franklin would draw people into making concessions that would gradually prove whatever point he was trying to assert.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>As part of his self-improvement course, Franklin read the essays, took brief notes, and laid them aside for a few days. Then he tried to recreate the essay in his own words, after which he compared his composition to the original. Sometimes he would jumble up the notes he took, so that he would have to figure out on his own the best order to build the essay's argument.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>American individualists sometimes boast of not worrying about what others think of them. Franklin, more typically, nurtured his reputation, as a matter of both pride and utility, and he became the country's first unabashed public relations expert.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>With a population of two thousand, Philadelphia was then America's second-largest village after Boston.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Franklin honed the Socratic method he found so useful for winning arguments without antagonizing opponents. He would ask Keimer questions that seemed innocent and tangential but eventually exposed his logical fallacies.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Osborne, falling for the ruse, heaped praise on it, teaching Franklin a rule of human nature that served him well (with a few exceptions) throughout his career: people are more likely to admire your work if you're able to keep them from feeling jealous of you.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>A secret to being more revered than resented, he learned, was to display (at least when he could muster the discipline) a self-deprecating humor, unpretentious demeanor, and unaggressive style in conversation.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Franklin's key insight was that hard currency, such as silver and gold, was not the true measure of a nation's wealth: "The riches of a country are to be valued by the quantity of labor its inhabitants are able to purchase, and not by the quantity of silver and gold they possess.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>It was not in Franklin's nature, however, to be dogmatic or extreme about any principle; he generally gravitated toward a sensible balance.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Gossip can also, he noted, promote virtue, as some people are motivated more by fear of public humiliation than they are by inner moral principles.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>In addition, he showed a somewhat cynical side by implying that most people act virtuously not because of an inner goodness, but because they are afraid of public censure.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Around that time, Franklin developed a method for making difficult decisions. "My way is to divide a sheet of paper by a line into two columns, writing over the one Pro and the other Con," he later recalled. Then he would list all the arguments on each side and weigh how important each was.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>In his autobiography (which extols the virtues of "industry" and "frugality" a total of thirty-six times), Franklin wrote of his wife, "It was lucky for me that I had one as much disposed to industry and frugality as myself." He gives her even more credit in a letter written later, near the end of his life: "Frugality is an enriching virtue, a virtue I could never acquire in myself, but I was lucky enough to find it in a wife, who thereby became a fortune to me.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Above all, Franklin's beliefs were driven by pragmatism. The final sentence of his Junto talk stressed that it was socially useful for people to believe in the version of divine providence and free will that he proposed: "This religion will be a powerful regulator of our actions, give us peace and tranquility within our own minds, and render us benevolent, useful and beneficial to others.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>First he made a list of twelve virtues he thought desirable, and to each he appended a short definition: Temperance: Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation. Order: Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time. Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve. Frugality: Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; (i.e., waste nothing). Industry: Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions. Sincerity: Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly. Justice: Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty. Moderation: Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve. Cleanliness: Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation. Tranquility: Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable. Chastity: Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The set of virtues was also, as Edmund Morgan and others have pointed out, somewhat selfish. It did not include benevolence or charity, for example. But in fairness, we must remember that this was a young tradesman's plan for self-improvement, not a full-blown statement of his morality.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>On the pages of a little notebook, he made a chart with seven red columns for the days of the week and thirteen rows labeled with his virtues. Infractions were marked with a black spot. The first week he focused on temperance, trying to keep that line clear while not worrying about the other lines. With that virtue strengthened, he could turn his attention to the next one, silence, hoping that the temperance line would stay clear as well. In the course of the year, he would complete the thirteen-week cycle four times.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>I was surprised to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined," he dryly noted.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Indeed, he poked fun at professions of faith that served little worldly purpose. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Instead, he fit squarely into the tradition--indeed, was the first great American exemplar--of the Enlightenment and its Age of Reason. That movement, which rose in Europe in the late seventeenth century, was defined by an emphasis on reason and observable experience, a mistrust of religious orthodoxy and traditional authority, and an optimism about education and progress. To this mix, Franklin added elements of his own pragmatism. He was able (as novelist John Updike and historian Henry Steele Commager, among others, have noted) to appreciate the energies inherent in Puritanism and to liberate them from rigid dogma so they could flower in the freethinking atmosphere of the Enlightenment.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>In his writings about religion over the next five decades, Franklin rarely displayed much fervor. This is largely because he felt it was futile to wrestle with theological questions about which he had no empirical evidence and thus no rational basis for forming an opinion. Thunderbolts from heaven were, for him, something to be captured by a kite string and studied.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>What he found more satisfactory--more than metaphysics or poetry or exalted romantic sentiments--was looking at things in a pragmatic and practical way.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Years later, Franklin would recall that he regarded his almanac as a "vehicle for conveying instruction among the common folk" and therefore filled it with proverbs that "inculcated industry and frugality as the means of procuring wealth and thereby securing virtue.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Tocqueville came to the conclusion that there was an inherent struggle in America between two opposing impulses: the spirit of rugged individualism versus the conflicting spirit of community and association building. Franklin would have disagreed. A fundamental aspect of Franklin's life, and of the American society he helped to create, was that individualism and communitarianism, so seemingly contradictory, were interwoven. The frontier attracted barn-raising pioneers who were ruggedly individualistic as well as fiercely supportive of their community. Franklin was the epitome of this admixture of self-reliance and civic involvement, and what he exemplified became part of the American character.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>In doing so, he learned one of his pragmatic lessons about jealousy and modesty: he found that people were reluctant to support a "proposer of any useful project that might be supposed to raise one's reputation." So he put himself "as much as I could out of sight" and gave credit for the idea to his friends. This method worked so well that "I ever after practiced it on such occasions." People will eventually give you the credit, he noted, if you don't try to claim it at the time. "The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>At its core was a somewhat new concept that became known as federalism. A "General Government" would handle matters such as national defense and westward expansion, but each colony would keep its own constitution and local governing power.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>When one has so many different people with different opinions to deal with in a new affair," he explained to his friend Cadwallader Colden, "one is obliged sometimes to give up some smaller points in order to obtain greater." It was a sentiment he would express in similar words when he became the key conciliator at the Constitutional Convention thirty-three years later.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Throughout his life, Franklin would find himself torn (and amused) by the conflict between his professed desire to acquire the virtue of humility and his natural thirst for acclaim.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>His economic conservatism was balanced, however, by his fundamental moral belief that actions should be judged by how much they benefit the common good. Policies that encouraged hard work were good, but not because they led to great accumulations of private wealth; they were good because they increased the total well-being of a community and the dignity of every aspiring individual. People who acquired more wealth than they needed had a duty to help others and to create civic institutions that promoted the success of others. "His ideal was of a prosperous middle class whose members lived simple lives of democratic equality," writes James Campbell. "Those who met with greater economic success in life were responsible to help those in genuine need; but those who from lack of virtue failed to pull their own weight could expect no help from society.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>So it began work on what would become the Articles of Confederation. The document was not completed until late 1777, and it would take another four years before all the colonies ratified it, but the basic principles were decided during the weeks following the declaration of independence.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>In the Articles of Confederation plan he had submitted a year earlier, Franklin proposed a strong central government run by a popularly elected congress based on proportional representation. By temperament and upbringing, he was among the most democratic of the colonial leaders. Nevertheless, it voted to keep the system of one vote per state.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The smaller states had argued that they would be overwhelmed by the larger ones if there was proportional representation.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Another issue was whether slaves should be counted as part of a state's population for the purpose of assessing its tax liability. No, argued one South Carolina delegate, slaves were not population but property, more akin to sheep than to people. This drew a rebuke from Franklin: "There is some difference between them and sheep: Sheep will never make any insurrections.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Franklin was unanimously chosen as its president, and his main contribution was to push for a legislature composed of only one house. The idea of balancing the power of a directly elected legislature with an indirectly chosen "upper" house, he contended, was a vestige of the aristocratic and elitist system against which America was rebelling. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Into his hands, almost as much as those of Washington and others, had been placed the fate of the Revolution. Unless he could secure the support of France--its aid, its recognition, its navy--America would find it difficult to prevail. Already the greatest American scientist and writer of his time, he would display a dexterity that would make him the greatest American diplomat of all times. He played to the romance as well as the reason that entranced France's philosophes, to the fascination with America's freedom that captivated its public, and to the cold calculation of national interest that moved its ministers.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>As Claude-Anne Lopez notes, "In colonial America it was sinful to look idle, in France it was vulgar to look busy.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>That authority now resided with Adams, and Franklin put his own spin on the Congress's choice: "If the Congress have therefore entrusted to others rather than to me the negotiations for peace, when such shall be set on foot, as has been reported, it is perhaps because they may have heard of a very singular opinion of mine, that there hardly ever existed such a thing as a bad peace, or a good war, and that I might therefore easily be induced to make improper concessions.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Adams believed that America's foreign policy should be based on realism; Franklin believed that it should also include an element of idealism, both as a moral duty and as a component of America's national interests.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>From his opening gambit that led to America's treaty of alliance with France to the endgame that produced a peace with England while preserving French friendship, Franklin mastered a three-dimensional game against two aggressive players by exhibiting great patience when the pieces were not properly aligned and carefully exploiting strategic advantages when they were.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Franklin had been instrumental in shaping the three great documents of the war: the Declaration of Independence, the alliance with France, and the treaty with England.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>"Ever since the days of his electricity experiments, Franklin believed that science should be pursued initially for pure fascination and curiosity, and then practical uses would eventually flow from what was discovered. At first, he was reluctant to guess what practical use might come of balloons, but he was convinced that experimenting with them would someday, as he told Banks, "pave the way to some discoveries in natural philosophy of which at present we have no conception." There could be, he noted in another letter, "important consequences that no one can foresee." </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Franklin's affection for the middle class and its virtues of hard work and frugality meant that his social theories tended to be a blend of conservatism (as we have seen, he was dubious of generous welfare laws that led to dependency among the poor) and populism (he was opposed to the privileges of inheritance and to wealth idly gained through ownership of large estates). In 1784, he expanded on these ideas by questioning the morality of excess personal luxuries.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Franklin's blend of beliefs would become part of the outlook of much of America's middle class: its faith in the virtues of hard work and frugality, its benevolent belief in voluntary associations to help others, its conservative opposition to handouts that led to laziness and dependency, and its slightly ambivalent resentment of unnecessary luxury, hereditary privileges, and an idle landowning leisure class.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Jefferson was everything that Adams was not: diplomatic and charming, partial to France, secure rather than jealous, a lover of women and social gaiety with no Puritan prudishness. He was also a philosopher, inventor, and scientist whose Enlightenment curiosity meshed perfectly with Franklin's. Third, and what would prove most important of all, he embodied a spirit of Enlightenment tolerance and pragmatic compromise. "Both sides must part with some of their demands," he preached at one point, in a phrase that would be his mantra. "We are sent hither to consult, not to contend, with each other," he said at another.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>These three attributes proved invaluable in resolving the core issues facing the convention. The greatest of these was whether America would remain thirteen separate states or become one nation, or--if the demigods could prove so ingenious--some magical combination of both, as Franklin had first suggested in his Albany Plan of Union back in 1754.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>After making his plea that members consult rather than contend, he expressed a sentiment that he had preached for much of his life, starting with the rules he had written for his Junto sixty years earlier, about the dangers of being too assertive in debate. "Declarations of a fixed opinion, and of determined resolution never to change it, neither enlighten nor convince us," he said. "Positiveness and warmth on one side, naturally beget their like on the other." He had personally been willing, he said, to revise many of his opinions, including the desirability of a unicameral legislature. Now it was time for all members to compromise. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>More important than his specific ideas was his tone of moderation and conciliation. His speech, with its openness to new ideas and absence of one-sided advocacy, provided time for tempers to cool, and his call for creative compromises had an effect.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>A few minutes later, Roger Sherman of Connecticut rose to suggest another possible approach: the House of Representatives would be apportioned by population and the Senate would have equal votes for each state. Samuel Johnson, also of that state, explained the thinking behind what would become known as the Connecticut Compromise. The new country was, in some ways, "one political society," but in other ways it was a federation of separate states, yet these two concepts need not conflict, for they could be combined as "halves of a unique whole.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>First Franklin succinctly stated the problem: "The diversity of opinions turns on two points. If a proportional representation takes place, the small States contend that their liberties will be in danger. If an equality of votes is to be put in its place, the large States say their money will be in danger”.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The point Franklin was about to make, no doubt, was the same one he had made in the Pennsylvania state convention in 1776, when he argued against a two-chamber legislature because it might fall prey to the fate of the fabled two-headed snake that died of thirst when its heads could not agree on which way to pass a twig. Indeed, in a paper he wrote in 1789 extolling Pennsylvania's unicameral legislature, he again referred to what he called "the famous political fable of the snake with two heads." He had come to accept, however, that in forging the compromise needed to create a national Congress, two heads could be better than one.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>When Hamilton favored making the president a near-monarch to be chosen for life, Franklin noted that he provided living proof that a person's life sometimes lasted longer than his mental and physical prime. Instead, it would be more democratic to relegate the president to the role of average citizen after his term. The argument that "returning to the mass of the people was degrading," he said, "was contrary to republican principles. In free Governments the rulers are the servants, and the people their superiors and sovereigns.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>On only one issue did Franklin take what could be considered the less democratic position, though he did not recognize it as such. Federal officials, he argued, should serve without pay. In The Radicalism of the American Revolution, historian Gordon Wood contends that Franklin's proposal reflected the "classical sentiments of aristocratic leadership." Even John Adams, generally less democratic in his outlook, wrote from London that under such a policy "all offices would be monopolized by the rich, the poor and middling ranks would be excluded and an aristocratic despotism would immediately follow.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>I cannot help expressing a wish that every member of the convention who may still have objections to it, would, with me, on this occasion, doubt a little of his own infallibility, and, to make manifest our unanimity.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>He was the only person to sign all four of its founding papers: the Declaration of Independence, the treaty with France, the peace accord with Britain, and the Constitution.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>For him, compromise was not only a practical approach but a moral one. Tolerance, humility, and a respect for others required it. On almost every issue for more than two centuries, this supposed fault has served the Constitution, and the nation it formed, quite well. There was only one great issue that could not, then or later, be solved by constitutional compromise: slavery. And that indeed was the issue on which Franklin, as his life neared its end, chose to take an uncompromising stand.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Even in brotherly Philadelphia, ownership continued to climb until about 1760, when almost 10 percent of the city's population were slaves. But views had begun to evolve, especially after the ringing words of the Declaration and the awkward compromises of the Constitution. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Franklin's conversion culminated in 1787, when he accepted the presidency of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery. The group tried to persuade him to present a petition against slavery at the Constitutional Convention, but knowing the delicate compromises being made between north and south, he kept silent on the issue. After that, however, he became outspoken. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>There were about seven hundred thousand slaves in the United States out of a total population of four million in 1790.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>It is not surprising that, at the end of their lives, many people take stock of their religious beliefs. Franklin had never fully joined a church nor subscribed to a sectarian dogma, and he found it more useful to focus on earthly issues rather than spiritual ones.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>His support for religion tended to be based on his belief that it was useful and practical in making people behave better, rather than because it was divinely inspired. He wrote a letter, possibly sent in 1786 to Thomas Paine, in response to a manuscript that ridiculed religious devotion. Franklin begged the recipient not to publish his heretical treatise, but he did so on the grounds that the arguments could have harmful practical effects, not on the grounds that they were false. "You yourself may find it easy to live a virtuous life without the assistance afforded by religion," he said, "but think how great a proportion of mankind consists of weak and ignorant men and women, and of inexperienced and inconsiderate youth of both sexes, who have need of the motives of religion to restrain them from vice."</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Then an abscess in his lung burst, making it impossible for him to talk. Benny approached his bed, and his grandfather reached out to hold his hand for a long time. At eleven that evening, April 17, 1790, Franklin died at the age of 84.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The aspiring tradesmen of Boston and Philadelphia: The most unusual provision in the codicil to Franklin's will was a trust he established. He noted that, unlike the other founders of the country, he was born poor and had been helped in his rise by those who supported him as a struggling artisan. "I wish to be useful even after my death, if possible, in forming and advancing other young men that may be serviceable to their country." So he designated the Â£2,000 he had earned as President of Pennsylvania--citing his often expressed belief that officials should serve without pay--to be split between the towns of Boston and Philadelphia and provided as loans, "at 5 percent per annum, to such young married artificers" who had served apprenticeships and were now seeking to establish their own businesses. With his usual obsession with detail, he described precisely how the loans and repayments would work, and he calculated that after one hundred years, the annuities would each be worth £131,000. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>He represents one side of a national dichotomy that has existed since the days when he and Jonathan Edwards stood as contrasting cultural figures. On one side were those, like Edwards and the Mather family, who believed in an anointed elect and in salvation through God's grace alone. They tended to have a religious fervor, a sense of social class and hierarchy, and an appreciation for exalted values over earthly ones. On the other side were the Franklins, those who believed in salvation through good works, whose religion was benevolent and tolerant, and who were unabashedly striving and upwardly mobile.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The side of social mobility rather than an established elite. The side of middle-class virtues rather than more ethereal noble aspirations.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>This Age of Enlightenment, however, was being replaced in the early 1800s by a literary era that valued romanticism more than rationality. With the shift came a profound reversal, especially among those of presumed higher sensibilities, in attitudes toward Franklin. The romantics admired not reason and intellect but deep emotion, subjective sensibility, and imagination. They exalted the heroic and the mystical rather than tolerance and rationality. Their haughty criticisms decimated the reputations of Franklin.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The Great Depression of the 1930s reminded people that the virtues of industry and frugality, of helping others and making sure that the community held together, did not deserve to be dismissed as trivial and mundane. Franklin's reputation again made a comeback. The pragmatist philosopher Herbert Schneider, in his book The Puritan Mind, pointed out that the previous attacks had mainly been on Poor Richard's preachings rather than on how Franklin really lived his life, which did not focus on the pursuit of wealth for its own sake.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>In most of the endeavors of his soul and mind, his greatness sprang more from his practicality than from profundity or poetry. In science he was more an Edison than a Newton, in literature more a Twain than a Shakespeare, in philosophy more a Dr. Johnson than a Bishop Berkeley, and in politics more a Burke than a Locke.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>More important, Franklin did in fact believe, uncompromisingly, in a few high principles--very important ones for shaping a new nation--that he stuck to throughout his life. Having learned from his brother a resistance to establishment power, he was ever unwavering in his opposition to arbitrary authority. That led him to be unflinching in opposing the unfair tax policies the Penns tried to impose, even when it would have served his personal advantage to go along. It also meant that, despite his desire to find a compromise with Britain during the 1770s, he adhered firmly to the principle that American citizens and their legislatures must not be treated as subservient. Similarly, he helped to create, and came to symbolize, a new political order in which rights and power were based not on the happen-stance of heritage but on merit and virtue and hard work. He rose up the social ladder, from runaway apprentice to dining with kings, in a way that would become quintessentially American. But in doing so he resolutely resisted, as a matter of principle, sometimes to a fur-capped extreme, taking on elitist pretensions.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow leather-aprons more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a "dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people.</p></li>
