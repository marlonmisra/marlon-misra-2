    <h3 style="margin-top:0px">Kahlil Gibran - The prophet</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Summary</h4>

	<p class='v-project-description'>
	<i>The Prophet</i> was written by a Lebanese poet Kahlil Gibran in the early 1920s. 26 prose poetry essays depict Almustafa, the protagonist who lives in the foreign city of Orphalese for 12 years. Before Almustafa leaves the city, he shares his values and understanding of the human condition with the people of his town.  

	<br><br>

	Regarding relationships, he says that there should be space in ones togetherness. You should love yourself, think for yourself, be independent, all while doing your part in a relationship. When you raise children you have to realize that they do not belong to you and that you should thus let them draw their own conclusions. One metaphor he uses is a bow and arrow where parents represent the bow from which children are sent forth. Regarding work, he says that loving life through labor is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret. I agree that doing impactful and meaningful work is the best way to live. He suggests that life is darkness without urge, urge is blind without knowledge, and knowledge is empty without love, and when you work with love you succeed. That’s deep. 

	<br><br>

	He says that we should accept the cyclicality of life. We already accept the different seasons, so why can’t we do the same with life? A steady mind is important because every life is full of swings. I think that a steady mind will develop with age. I don’t think there’s a way to speed up the process but I believe it’s helpful to remember that every person goes through shitty situations. Gibran also says that no one can truly change you and that you have to embrace change instead. Teachers cannot give wisdom, musicians cannot give you voice. I strongly agree. 

	<br><br>

	He suggests that people speak when they are at cease with their own thoughts. I have found this to be true and important. People who speak slower seem more knowledgeable and are more knowledgeable because they give thought to their words. Silence shows strength and interrupting others is unnecessary and rude. I have been working on this for a while but habits are lost slowly. It’s so difficult to inhibit excitement. 

	<br><br>

	He explains that evilness is nothing but good tortured by hunger and thirst. That passage reminded me of <i>Lord of the Flies</i>. People act vastly different under in new circumstances and that is why open mindedness is such an important virtue.

	<h4>Quotes</h4>

	<ul class='v-project-description'>
	<li><p>The timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness. And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.</p></li>

	<li><p>The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.</p></li>

	<li><p>And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.</p></li>

	<li><p>You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.</p></li>

	<li><p>You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts.</p></li>

	<li><p>If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life. For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.</p></li>

	<li><p>And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge, And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge. And all knowledge is vain save when there is work, And all work is empty save when there is love.</p></li>

	</ul>

  <h4>Highlights</h4>

	<ul class='v-project-description'>
  <li><p>You were born together, and together you shall be for evermore. You shall be together when the white wings of death s  catter your days. Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God. But let there be spaces in your togetherness. And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another, but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth’s furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born, And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life, And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>You have been told also that life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary. And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge, And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge. And all knowledge is vain save when there is work, And all work is empty save when there is love; And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God. And what is it to work with love? It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth. It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house. It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit. It is to charge all things your fashion with a breath of your own spirit, And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge. The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness. If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind. The astronomer may speak to you of his understanding of space, but he cannot give you his understanding. The musician may sing to you of the rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot give you the ear which arrests the rhythm, nor the voice that echoes it. And he who is versed in the science of numbers can tell of the regions of weight and measure, but he cannot conduct you thither. For the vision of one man lends not its wings to another man. And even as each one of you stands alone in God’s knowledge, so must each one of you be alone in his knowledge of God and in his understanding of the earth.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>And then a scholar said, Speak of Talking. And he answered, saying: You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts; And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime. And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered. For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone. The silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves and they would escape. And there are those who talk, and without knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand. And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not in words. In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>But if in your thought you must measure time into seasons, let each season encircle all the other seasons, And let to-day embrace the past with remembrance and the future with longing.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Of the good in you I can speak, but not of the evil. For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst? Verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, and when it thirsts it drinks even of dead waters.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Then a hermit, who visited the city once a year, came forth and said, Speak to us of Pleasure. And he answered, saying: Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom. It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>And now you ask in your heart, “How shall we distinguish that which is good in pleasure from that which is not good?” Go to your fields and your gardens, and you shall learn that it is the pleasure of the bee to gather honey of the flower, But it is also the pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to the bee. For to the bee a flower is a fountain of life, And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love, And to both, bee and flower, the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy. People of Orphalese, be in your pleasures like the flowers and the bees.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life. For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>And what is it to cease breathing but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered?</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>You have been told that, even like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest link. This is but half the truth. You are also as strong as your strongest link. To measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by the frailty of its foam. To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconstancy.</p></li>
