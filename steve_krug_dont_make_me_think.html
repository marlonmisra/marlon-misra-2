    <h3 style="margin-top:0px">Steve Krug - Don't make me think</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Summary</h4>

	<p class='v-project-description'>
	Krug starts the book with a fundamental truth about design which is that technology changes quickly and people change very slowly. Usability is concerned with people and how they understand and use things. The goal of usability is to not make people think. In other words, the goal of every product should be to be self-evident.

	<br><br>

	When users scan websites, false interpretations of their behavior are common. Users quickly glance through pages and immediately click on the links that match what they search for. Three rules that summarize this behavior are that users only scan pages, they sacrifice with choices, and they don’t figure out how things work but muddle through. Instead of optimizing for the least number of clicks, you should make each click as mindless as possible. It is bad to go against convention and a new path is justified only if the replacement is self-evident or the learning curve is worth the value add. If something can be made clearer by sacrificing some consistency, one should always choose in favor of clarity. Important things should be more prominent and related things should make use of categorization and visual symmetry. Bulleted lists are almost always good. Tooltips can be used to describe difficult functionality. Breadcrumbs can be used to show hierarchy. 

	<br><br>

	Focus groups with users are great to determine if you are building the right product and this is should be done before designing anything. Usability tests are useful during the entire development process. In usability tests, you should ask users to think out loud and record everything. It’s important to train user empathy. Especially when you work on a website for a long time, you can’t see it freshly anymore. Thus testing is key.

	<h4>Lessons</h4>

	<ul class='v-project-description'>

	<li><p>People change slowly and technology changes quickly.</p></li>

	<li><p>Do focus groups before development and usability tests throughout development.</p></li>

	<li><p>Make the user experience self-evident.</p></li>

  <li><p>Be careful when you work on a product for long because you won’t see it freshly.</p></li>

	</ul>

	<br>

	<h4>Quotes</h4>

	<ul class='v-project-description'>

	<li><p>Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what’s left.</p></li>

	<li><p>If you want a great site, you’ve got to test. After you’ve worked on a site for even a few weeks, you can’t see it freshly anymore. You know too much. The only way to find out if it really works is to test it.</p></li>

	<li><p>In reality, though, most of the time we don’t choose the best option—we choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisficing.</p></li>

	<li><p>Happy talk must die. </p></li>

	</ul>

	<br>

    <h4>Highlights</h4>

	<ul class='v-project-description'>

  <li><p>The basic principles are the same even if the landscape has changed, because usability is about people and how they understand and use things, not about technology. And while technology often changes quickly, people change very slowly.</p></li>

  <li><p>People often ask me: "What's the most important thing I should do if I want to make sure my site or app is easy to use?" The answer is simple. It's not "Nothing important should ever be more than two clicks away" or "Speak the user's language" or "Be consistent." It's... "Don't make me think!" </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>There's almost always a plausible rationale--and a good, if misguided, intention--behind every usability flaw. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>All kinds of things on a Web page can make us stop and think unnecessarily. Take names, for example. Typical culprits are cute or clever names, marketing-induced names, company-specific names, and unfamiliar technical names.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The point is that every question mark adds to our cognitive workload, distracting our attention from the task at hand.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Your goal should be for each page or screen to be self-evident, so that just by looking at it the average user will know what it is and how to use it. In other words, they'll "get it" without having to think about it. Here's the rule: If you can't make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>When we're creating sites, we act as though people are going to pore over each page, reading all of our carefully crafted text, figuring out how we've organized things, and weighing their options before deciding which link to click. What they actually do most of the time (if we're lucky) is glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they're looking for. There are almost always large parts of the page that they don't even look at. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Fact 1: We don't read pages. We scan them. Fact 2: We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice. Fact 3: We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Faced with any sort of technology, very few people take the time to read instructions. Instead, we forge ahead and muddle through, making up our own vaguely plausible stories about what we're doing and why it works.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Faced with the fact that your users are whizzing by, there are some important things you can do to make sure they see and understand as much of what they need to know--and of what you want them to know--as possible: Take advantage of conventions. Create effective visual hierarchies. Break pages up into clearly defined areas. Make it obvious what's clickable. Eliminate distractions. Format content to support scanning</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Faced with the prospect of following a convention, there's a great temptation for designers to try reinventing the wheel instead, largely because they feel (not incorrectly) that they've been hired to do something new and different, not the same old thing. Not to mention the fact that praise from peers, awards, and high-profile job offers are rarely. If you're not going to use an existing Web convention, you need to be sure that what you're replacing it with either (a) is so clear and self-explanatory that there's no learning curve--so it's as good as the convention, or (b) adds so much value that it's worth a small learning curve.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>If you can make something significantly clearer by making it slightly inconsistent, choose in favor of clarity.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The more important something is, the more prominent it is.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Things that are related logically are related visually.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Things are "nested" visually to show what's part of what. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>When you're editing your Web pages, it's probably a good idea to start with the assumption that everything is visual noise (the "presumed guilty until proven innocent" approach) and get rid of anything that's not making a real contribution. In the face of limited time and attention, everything that's not part of the solution must go.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Here are the most important things you can do to make your pages scan-friendly: Use bulleted lists. Think of it this way: Almost anything that can be a bulleted list probably should be. Highlight key terms. Much page scanning consists of looking for key words and phrases. Formatting the most important ones in bold where they first appear in the text makes them easier to find.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>It doesn't matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>On the face of it, "number of clicks to get anywhere" seems like a useful metric. But over time I've come to think that what really counts is not the number of clicks it takes me to get to what I want (although there are limits), but rather how hard each click is--the amount of thought required and the amount of uncertainty about whether I'm making the right choice. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>When you can't avoid giving me a difficult choice, you need to go out of your way to give me as much guidance as I need--but no more. This guidance works best when it's Brief: The smallest amount of information that will help me. Timely: Placed so I encounter it exactly when I need it. Unavoidable: Formatted in a way that ensures that I'll notice it. Examples are tips adjacent to form fields, "What's this?" links, and even tool tips. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Another major source of needless words is instructions. The main thing you need to know about instructions is that no one is going to read them--at least not until after repeated attempts at "muddling through" have failed. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>When we want to return to something on a Web site, instead of relying on a physical sense of where it is we have to remember where it is in the conceptual hierarchy and retrace our steps. This is one reason why bookmarks--stored personal shortcuts--are so important, and why the Back button is the most used button in Web browsers.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Given the power of searching and the number of people who prefer searching to browsing, unless a site is very small and very well organized, every page should have either a search box or a link to a search page. And unless there's very little reason to search your site, it should be a search box.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Every page needs a name. Just as every corner should have a street sign, every page should have a name.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Breadcrumbs show you the path from the Home page to where you are and make it easy to move back up to higher levels in the hierarchy of a site.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>If the page is well designed, when your vision clears you should be able to answer these questions without hesitation: What site is this? (Site ID) What page am I on? (Page name) What are the major sections of this site? (Sections) What are my options at this level? (Local navigation) Where am I in the scheme of things? ("You are here" indicators) How can I search?</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>As a result, the Home page is the waterfront property of the Web: It's the most desirable real estate, and there's a very limited supply. Everybody who has a stake in the site wants a promo or a link to their section on the Home page, and the turf battles for Home page visibility can be fierce. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>This is what I call the Big Bang Theory of Web Design. Like the Big Bang Theory, it's based on the idea that the first few seconds you spend on a new Web site or Web page are critical. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Compared to the early days of the Web, the Home page has lost its preeminence. Now people are just as likely--or more likely--to enter your site by clicking on a link in an email, a blog, or something from a social network that takes them directly to a page deep in your site. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>As a result, people have now come to expect a short explanatory video on most sites and are often willing to watch them. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The kinds of things you learn from focus groups--like whether you're building the right product--are things you should know before you begin designing or building anything, so focus groups are best used in the planning stages of a project. Usability tests, on the other hand, should be used through the entire process.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>I think every Web development team should spend one morning a month doing usability testing. I think the ideal number of participants for each round of do-it-yourself testing is three.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>It's good to do your testing with participants who are like the people who will use your site, but the truth is that recruiting people who are from your target audience isn't quite as important as it may seem. For many sites, you can do a lot of your testing with almost anybody.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Think out loud as much as possible.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>One way to look at design--any kind of design--is that it's essentially about constraints (things you have to do and things you can't do) and tradeoffs (the less-than-ideal choices you make to live within the constraints).</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>If there are two things I can tell you about scalable design (aka dynamic layout, fluid design, adaptive design, and responsive design), they're these: It tends to be a lot of work. It's very hard to do it well.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Affordances require visual distinctions. But the recent trend in interface design (which may have waned by the time you read this) has moved in exactly the opposite direction: removing visual distinctions and "flattening" the appearance of interface elements. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Memorability can be a big factor in whether people adopt an app for regular use. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The whole point of hiding support phone numbers is to try to keep users from calling, because each call costs money. The usual effect is to diminish goodwill and ensure that they'll be even more annoyed when they do find the number and call. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Things that diminish goodwill Here are a few of the things that tend to make users feel like the people publishing a site don't have their best interests at heart: Hiding information that I want. Punishing me for not doing things your way. I should never have to think about formatting data. Asking me for information you don't really need. </p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Know what questions I'm likely to have, and answer them. Frequently Asked Questions lists are enormously valuable.</p></li>

  <li><p>When in doubt, apologize.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>The one argument for accessibility that doesn't get made nearly often enough is how extraordinarily better it makes some people's lives.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>One difference between User Centered Design and User Experience Design is their scope. UCD focused on designing the right product and making sure that it was usable. UX sees its role as taking the users' needs into account at every stage of the product life cycle, from the time they see an ad on TV, through purchasing it and tracking its delivery online, and even returning it to a local branch store.</p></li>
