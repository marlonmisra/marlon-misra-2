    <h3>Improving engineering education</h3>
    <p class='v-project-description'>
      How can universities improve engineering education? If we look at top technical schools, most are hundreds of years old, are located in key technology hubs, and have massive endowments. So is there anything a university can do to flourish faster? 

      <br><br>

      When I worked in San Francisco last summer, I learned that one of the most respected institutions is the University of Waterloo. The school was founded in 1956, is located in a shitty city in Southwestern Ontario, and has an endowment of only 300M. Nonetheless, the school has an incredible reputation. 

      <br><br>

      Sal Khan says that “if you go to Silicon Valley right now - Google, Facebook, even Khan Academy - most interns are from Waterloo. [1]  Paul Graham recently said that “applications we get from Waterloo students are better than those we get from students of any other university.” [2] In a 2005 interview, Bill gates said that “most years, we hire more students out of Waterloo than any university in the world”. [3] So what is it that Waterloo does so well, and what else should ambitious universities do?  

      <br><br>

      <b>Focus on work experience </b>
      <br>
      Try to find an engineering student that would trade an internship for 4 months of classes. It won’t be easy. For most students, internships are incredibly valuable. Waterloo is acutely aware of this which is why they made the decision to create a co-op curriculum where students alternate between classes and six required work terms. The setup helps students focus on specific things at work and learn theory in classes. The internships help students figure out what they really like and make better course selections. So how did Waterloo execute this so well?

      <br><br>

      They started small and partnered with enough companies so that students had a high probability of getting jobs. Then they gave students the experience they needed with internships. Then they scaled. Now they have 18,400 co-op students and a 97% co-op employment rate. [4] When companies look to hire graduates, who do they choose? They’ll probably choose the Waterloo engineer who’s done 6 internships and has 2 years of accumulated  work experience. Also, how amazing is it that many of those students can graduate with savings instead of enormous debt?

      <br><br>

      <b>Remove grades</b>
      <br>
      An evaluation system based on grades doesn’t make sense for a profession-focused engineering school. If you start with a small initial class, schools can ensure that they only accept great students. Employers should then make hiring decisions based on actual value creation. What does that mean? It means that co-op performance should carry more weight because it requires students to do real work. Co-op performance also happens to be the best predictor of full-time employee success. 

      <br><br>

      Now that grades are out of the picture, employers are forced to value creative pursuits more. Maybe starting a club or working at a startup will now carry extra weight. Maybe research projects and international exchanges will be more impressive. Perhaps the student’s open source contributions are the deciding factor. Students will be less stressed and collaboration would flourish. The positive effects on mental health would be drastic. Instead of stigmatizing mistakes via poor grades, imagine an education system that values creativity and value creation. We have to teach students that making mistakes isn’t so bad. It sounds like a crazy concept but it really isn’t. At Waterloo, students already receive co-op evaluations.

      <br><br>

      You might wonder how an employer should evaluate a student that hasn’t completed any or only few internships. The way to handle this is to only let students apply to a set amount (~5) of positions using the internal application system. If students think they can get jobs at top companies, they will apply to them. But if they aren’t ready, they should use the spots more wisely. Students can still still apply wherever they want on their own, but the internal system shouldn’t scare companie away with an unreasonable number of applications. 

      <br><br>

      <b>Treat everyone uniquely </b>
      <br>
      In Ken Robinson’s famous TED talk about education, he says that our education system is built on the same model as fast food. Everything is standardized and each student is treated the same. [6]

      <br><br>

      He’s right. When you select a major, you are required to take courses in a linear path. What if some of those courses don’t interest you? Too bad. What if you want to take a 4th-year course in freshman year because you already know the material? Too bad. What if you want to take less credits than recommended? Too bad. All these requirements should be removed. I should be able to make these decisions if I’m paying tuition. A system based on linearity and conformity is centuries too old. Schools optimize for well-roundedness but expertise in one subject is infinitely more valuable. If I discover a really interesting topic and Udacity offers a specialization for it, I should be able to do the specialization without worrying about missing class. 

      <br><br>

      If requirements are removed, students have to respond to real incentives that come from job demand and genuine interest. As credentials become less important, colleges will become more flexible. Fortunately, many programmers already come from boot camps and other non traditional avenues. Colleges will adapt eventually but the time do it is now. It’s time to recognize that education is not a mechanical process but an organic one.
