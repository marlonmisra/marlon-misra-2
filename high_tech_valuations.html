      Late 2014 valuations ($18B for Uber) and acquisitions ($22B for WhatsApp) are seemingly high. People are concerned about the magnitude of these numbers but the situation is distinctly different from the late 90s. There are reasons to be optimistc. 

      <br><br>

      <b>Mobile infrastructure and growth</b>
      <br>
      Uber is currently adding 50,000 new drivers per month. [1] WhatsApp is 5 years old and has 600,000,000 monthly active users which represent 8% of the global population. [2] These growth levels weren’t possible 20 years ago because the infrastructure didn’t support it. 1.7 billion people already have smartphones and competition is driving down phone prices exponentially. With infrastructure supporting faster growth and growth principally driving valuations, it makes sense that these companies have a major valuation premium. 

      <br><br>

      <b>Few winners take all</b>
      <br>
      While the infrastructure for growth is there, only few companies can benefit for two reasons. First, competitors have high barriers to entry because markets saturate so quickly. Second, users are unlikely to switch products because the networks they are part of are so valuable. The above two points make network-effect mobile tech a win-all game. There will only be few successful companies in each vertical but the winners will be much bigger than the rest. This means that monopolies will be more common and evolve naturally. And monopolies have huge valuation premiums. 

      <br><br>

      <b>Platform power</b>
      <br>
      If Apple wants to release a new product, they have to spend billions on R&D, marketing, and sales. But what does Uber have to do if they want to introduce a grocery delivery service? What does WhatsApp have to do to introduce mobile payments? For Uber and WhatsApp, the implementations are substantially easier. They can spin up teams and implement the required functionality in their existing apps. Companies that can easily expand product offerings get a massive valuation premium.
